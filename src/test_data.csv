LED Thermal Management
The housing design allows the one 
piece housing to provide excellent 
thermal management critical to long 
LED system life.
Infrared Motion Response
Integral IMRI module is a passive 
infrared (PIR) motion sensor 
mounted integral on driver enclosure 
and is available with a sensor lens 
type to accommodate mounting heights up to 40’ and occupancy 
coverage area up to 2,800 sq.ft (60’ 
in diameter). Motion response for 
option IMRI is set/operates in the 
following fashion: 
When motion is detected by the PIR 
sensor, the luminaire goes to full 
power/ light output. 
Dimming on low is factory set to 30% 
with 5 minute default in ""full power"" 
prior to dimming back to low. When no motion is detected for 5 minutes, 
the motion response system reduces 
the wattage by 70%, to 30% of the 
normal constant wattage reducing 
the light level. Mounting
Standard luminaire arm mounts to 
square poles. Round pole adapter included with every luminaire 
designed for 4” OD poles.
Energy Saving Benefits 
System efficacy up to 126lms/W with 
significant energy savings over Pulse 
Start Metal Halide luminaires.

ELECTRONICS 
Upon failure of the normal utility power, a solid-state transfer switch 
automatically activates the emergency LED lamp-heads. Upon resumption  
of normal utility power, the battery is disconnected from the load and 
recharged through a micro-controller based 3-stage charger. The battery  
is a maintenance-free Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) type. The EVHC 
series accepts 120 through 277VAC at 50 or 60 Hz. A low voltage battery 
disconnect (LVD) feature protects the battery from severe damage  
during prolonged power failures. Manual testing is available at any time  
using the push-to-test button.
The EVHCR2 can be mounted up to 53’ using 18 gage wire.

This unit includes a highly visual alert system to  communicate two failure modes which consist 
of “Replace Battery” or “Replace Unit”. The system works in conjunction with the Spectron Self-
Test/Self-Diagnostic functionality. If a malfunction occurs, the unit will flash a Service Alert code 
which is associated with either failure mode. In the case of REPLACE BATTERY, a new battery 
must be installed.  In the case of REPLACE UNIT, the unit  must be replaced. When the unit is in 
a serviceable condition, neither of the  failure modes are illuminated and the green LED is On.

November 30, 2021 2:02 PMINTEGRATED SENSOR
The Encounter and Encounter HP with Integrated Sensor technology provides automatic energy savings without sacrificing   
performance. Traditionally, these types of energy savings required coordination between the luminaire and a lighting control    
system. The Encounter delivers superior lighting with integrated occupancy and daylighting controls.   
Capture the benefits of traditional lighting controls, without complicated coverage planning or special wiring.       
Ideal for new construction or retrofit, the Encounter delivers automatic ON to an energy saving light level,      
while ensuring lighting is turned OFF when the space is unoccupied.
The integral daylight sensor reduces the need for special daylight zone planning. Each luminaire will      
automatically adjust the light level based on reflected light beneath the sensor in a closed loop method.
Occupied daylight light levels and unoccupied light levels can be adjusted using the integrated sensor     
programming remote (Catalog Number: ISHH-01). The integrated sensor personal remote (Catalog Number: ISHH-02)     
provides code compliant manual raise, lower, ON, OFF control. 
The Encounter with Integrated Sensor is easy to install with no special wiring and ensures energy savings out-of-the-box     
with default control settings. 
How it works: 
• As the user enters the space controlled by the integral sensor, the lighting turns ON to the default daylight level.  
• Lighting will remain at that the daylight level until the space is unoccupied. This will start the occupancy timeout period (default 20 minutes).
• If the space remains unoccupied for half of the timeout period, the lighting will automatically reduce to the Energy Saver light level.  This adjustable   
 light level is typically half of the occupied daylight level. 
• At the end of the timeout period the lighting will go to the unoccupied light level.  This adjustable light level uses the OFF default setting.

POWER AND CONTROL MOUNTING
Power Supply with 
Cooledge Control Module
Actual power & control 
configuration is determined 
by the luminaire model.FABRICated Luminaires offer two choices for 
locating the power and control components:
• Integrated: the mounting plate containing 
the power supply and control module may 
be secured to the top of the luminaire. AC 
electrical connections are made directly 
to the power supplies at the luminaire
• Remote Mounted: the mounting plate 
can be located remotely in a location that 
may be more suitable for AC electrical 
connection or for maintenance access 
(see www.cooledgelighting.com or contact 
Cooledge for remote distance wiring 
requirements)Power & Control Mounting Plate

Optical System
D
irect hemisphere: Light emitted from a linear array of downward-facing 
LEDs is laterally redirected using optical microstructures embedded in a 
layer of MesoOptics DX film to generate an optimal batwing distribution and 
a uniform continuum of light. The available Flush Silk lens is a value-oriented 
option that provides a lambertian distribution while maintaining a uniform 
continuum of light.
Additionally, Ledalite's unique Quad Optic Louver Cell provides 6 tailored 
optical distributions with reduced glare.
Indirect hemisphere: White light emitted from a linear array of upward-facing 
LEDs is shaped into a homogeneous, wide-throw batwing distribution or a 
low peak angle asymmetric throw using either a free-form elliptical lens or an 
engineered light guide panel.
Housing
Post  painted precision alumin um extrusion.
Endcaps
Diecast flat aluminum endcaps with integral groove to match housing.
Finish
High quality powder coated, available in s tandard M atte W hite, Black, 
Titanium Silver or Graphite Grey. TruGroove can also be specified in any 
custom color upon request for a one-time setup charge. Optional sensors

0-10V  This fixture is offered standard with 0-10V dimming driver(s) for use with a lighting control panel or other control method.
Photocontrol  (PC1, PC2 and PC) Optional button-type photocontrol provides a ﬂexible solution to enable “dusk-to-dawn” lighting by sensing light levels.   
After Hours Dim (AHD) This feature allows photocontrol-enabled luminaires to achieve additional energy savings by dimming during scheduled portions of the night. The 
dimming profile will automatically take effect after a “dusk-to-dawn” period has been calculated from the photocontrol input. Specify the desired dimming profile for a simple, 
factory-shipped dimming solution requiring no external control wiring. Reference the After Hours Dim supplemental guide for additional information.
Dimming Occupancy Sensor  (MSP/DIM-LXX and MSP-LXX) These sensors are factory installed in the luminaire housing. When the MSP/DIM-LXX sensor option is selected, 
the occupancy sensor is connected to a dimming driver and the entire luminaire dims when there is no activity detected. When activity is detected, the luminaire returns to full 
light output. The MSP/DIM sensor is factory preset to dim down to approximately 50 percent power with a time delay of ten minutes. The MSP-LXX sensor is factory preset to 
turn the luminaire off after five minutes of no activity. 
These occupancy sensors includes an integrated photocell that can be activated with the ISHH-01 accessory for “dusk-to-dawn” control or daylight harvesting - the factory 
preset is ON. The ISHH-01 is a wireless tool utilized for changing the dimming level, time delay, sensitivity and other parameters.
A variety of sensor lens are available to optimize the coverage pattern for mounting heights from 8’-30’.
WaveLinx Wireless Control and Monitoring System  The WaveLinx Outdoor control platform operates on a wireless mesh network based on IEEE 802.15.4 standards 
enabling wireless control of outdoor lighting. Use the WaveLinx Mobile application for set-up and configuration. At least one Wireless Area Controller (WAC) is required for full 
functionality and remote communication (including adjustment of any factory pre-sets). 
 
WaveLinx Wireless Sensor (WPS2 and WPS4) These outdoor sensors offer passive infrared (PIR) occupancy and a photocell for closed loop daylight sensing. These sensors 
are factory preset to dim down to approximately 50 percent power after 15 minutes of no activity detected. These occupancy sensors include an integral photocell for “dusk-
to-dawn” control or daylight harvesting that is factory-enabled. A variety of sensor lenses are available to optimize the coverage pattern for mounting heights from 7’-40’.
Enlighted Wireless Control and Monitoring System (LWR-LW and LWR-LN) The Enlighted System is a connected lighting solution that combines LED luminair es with an 
integrated wireless sensor system. The sensor controls the lighting system in compliance with the latest energy codes and collects valuable data about building performance 
and use. Software applications turn the granular data into information through energy dashboards and specialized apps that make it simple and help optimize the use of other 
resources beyond lighting. 0-10V

DIMENSIONS + WEIGHTALL SABIN PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO ACOUSTIC TESTING. PERFORMANCE 
VALUES WILL VARY BASED ON INSTALLATION FACTORS SUCH AS DENSITY AND 
MOUNTING HEIGHT.
SABINS A SABIN IS A UNIT OF SOUND ABSORPTION DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT OF 
SOUND ABSORBED BY ONE SQUARE FOOT OF A PERFECT ABSORBER. 
IT WAS INITIALL Y CONCEIVED AS THE EQUIVALENT OF 1 SQUARE FOOT 
OF OPEN WINDOW, REFLECTING NO SOUND BACK INTO THE INTERIOR. 
SABINS ARE USED TO EXPRESS THE TOTAL EFFECTIVE ABSORPTION FOR 
THE INTERIOR OF A ROOM. THIS CHART INDICATES AVERAGE SABINS PER 
UNIT AT THE NOTED FREQUENCIES WHICH REPRESENT THE TYPICAL 
RANGE OF HUMAN SPEECH OF 200-2500 HZ.
NRC NOISE REDUCTION COEFFICIENT (NRC) IS A SINGLE NUMBER VALUE 
RANGING FROM 0.0 TO 1.0 THAT DESCRIBES THE AVERAGE SOUND 
ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE OF A MATERIAL. AN NRC OF 0.0 INDICATES 
THE OBJECT DOES NOT ABSORB MID-FREQUENCY SOUND ENERGY , BUT 
REFLECTS IT. AN NRC OF 1.0 INDICATES THAT THE SOUND ABSORPTION 
PERFORMANCE OF THE MATERIAL IS EQUAL TO ITS SURFACE AREA 
(MEASURED IN UNITS SABIN), OR CONCEPTUALL Y 100% SOUND 
ABSORPTION.
PROJECTED NRC = .95
TOTAL SOUND ABSORPTION WILL VARY BASED ON DESIGNED PRODUCT CONFIGURATION.

LUMEN MAINTENANCE 
Designed to last with cool running mid-power LEDs projected 
to maintain 90% (L90) of their initial output for 100,000 hours 
(at HO), and L70 exceeding 150,000 hours.
LED SYSTEM LED modules and drivers are field replaceable.
PROG  
(OPTIONAL)Programmable light output. Specify desired lumens or watts  
per linear foot. Min: 21/2 w/ft, consult factory for requests 
above 12 w/ft.
BINNING Standard binning (all Prudential LED boards) includes testing 
at the chip level and board integration to provide consistent 
color temperature within a 3-step MacAdams ellipse, with +/- 
5% lumen output range and +/- .004 Duv.
LABELS CSA and ETL damp labeled and I.B.E.W. manufactured.ELECTRICAL Must specify LED dimming controls. LED fixtures have 
constant current driver(s) with less than 20% THD when 
loaded to a minimum of 60%. Drivers sink a maximum of 6mA 
per driver. DM01 LED drivers are 0-10V dimmable and are 
compatible with most 0-10V wall slide dimmers and direct 
0-10V analog signal dimmers.

closed-cell gasket. Three piece captive latches lock onto the housing and keep latches from becoming 
displaced during strenuous cleaning. 7/8"" opening on each end, suitable for use with 1/2"" trade size 
connector/conduit.
OPTICS  — Injection-molded acrylic, impact-resistant diffuser (.080"" thick), available in clear or frost -
ed, features side lineal prisms and frosted ends (clear). Frosted lens recommended for lower mounting 
heights and enhanced visual comfort. UV stabilized polycarbonate diffuser option available (.080"" 
thick) for increased impact resistance. Three piece stainless steel latches keep lens securely fastened.
ELECTRICAL  — Utilizes high-efficiency LEDs mounted to core circuit boards. High-efficiency drivers 
operate 120-480 volt offered with 0-10 volt dimming, allowing granular control when coupled with 
wireless networking controls. Luminaire Surge Protection Level: Designed to withstand up to 6kV/3kA

How to Estimate Delivered Lumens in Emergency Mode
Use the formula below to estimate the delivered lumens in emergency mode
Delivered Lumens = P x LPW
P = Output power of emergency driver.
LPW = Lumen per watt rating of the luminaire. (See charts on Page 4)
The LPW rating is also available at Designlight Consortium .
P = 10 watts for E10W

Madeira® LED
As shown: Acorn style with replica chimney, 
ornamental crown, and decorative ribsOptical Assembly 
The optical assembly is a precisely molded thermal resistant 
borosilicate glass reflector and retractor. The upper portion of this 
system incorporates a series of reflecting prisms that redirect over 
50% of the upward light into the controlling retractor while allowing 
a soft uplight component to define the traditional acorn shape. The 
lower portion uses precisely molded refracting prisms to control the 
distribution of light to maximize utilization, uniformity, and luminaire 
spacing. The top of this assembly is a removable decorative aluminum 
cover with a replica chimney finial for entry into the lamp chamber. 
A total of eight decorative ribs surround the prismatic glass reflector 
and refractor. Three unique optical assemblies are available, designed 
for IES type Ill, type IV, and type V distribution. 
Luminaire Housing 
A decorative leaf style cast aluminum luminaire housing cradles the 
optical assembly and provides an enclosure for the plug-in electrical 
module. The three station incoming line terminal block is prewired 
to a six conductor receptacle for ease in connecting the electrical 
module. A slipfitter will accept a 3 inch high by 2-7/8 inch to 3-1/8 
inch O.D. pipe tenon. 
Electrical Module / Luminaire Housing Door 
The decorative leaf style cast aluminum housing door contains the 
ballast components and is held in place by two captive 1/4-20 stainless 
steel screws. A matching six conductor plug connects to the receptacle 
in the luminaire housing to complete the wiring. 
Electrical Module 
The electronic components are mounted on a steel plate that is 
removable with minimum use of tools. A matching six conductor 
plug connects to the receptacle in the luminaire housing to complete 
the wiring. 
Electronic Driver 
AS drivers are programmable dimmable drivers, with 0-10V control 
leads and AH drivers are dimmable (0-10V) drivers .Finish/ Material 
All castings utilize aluminum for maximum corrosion resistance and 
all exposed hardware is corrosion resistant. 
The finish shall:
• Utilize a polyester power coat paint to ensure maximum durability
• Rigorous multi-stage pre-treating and painting process yields a 
finish that achieves a scribe creepage rating of 8 (per ASTM D1654) 
after over 5000 hours exposure to salt fog chamber (operated per 
ASTM B117) on standard and RAL finish options.
• RAL (RALxxxxSDCR) paint colors are Super Durable Corrosion 
Resistant, 80% gloss.
Installation 
Refer to the instruction manual provided with each luminaire as to the 
specific method of wiring and mounting the luminaire.

Use these factors to determine relative lumen output for 
average ambient temperatures from 0-40°C (32-104°F).Projected LED Lumen Maintenance
Data references the extrapolated performance projections for the platforms noted in a 25°C ambient, based on 10,000 hours of 
LED testing (tested per IESNA LM-80-08 and projected per IESNA TM-21-11 ).
To calculate LLF , use the lumen maintenance factor that corresponds to the desired number of operating hours below. For other 
lumen maintenance values, contact factory.
The italicized data is extrapolated beyond the TM-21 standard.

3 Customer can order only one FAA Aircraft Warning Light per Lowering Device. 
FAA Aircraft Warning Light operates on the lower system voltage entering the pole. Example If system voltage 
entering pole is 277/480V, then the FAA transformer operates off of 277V. 
FAA Aircraft Warning Light operation is ON and OFF with luminaires. When ordered with Photo Control Recep -
tacle Option, warning light in wired through receptacle. For alternate operation, or separate circuit, contact PSG.4 PR Photo Control Receptacle. Not available with JPHASE 347/600V. Single Circuit 1 all luminaires are controlled 
by photo control receptacle photocell and contactor. For double circuit 2, half of the luminaires are controlled 
by photo control receptacle photocell and contactor for an even number of luminaires. For an odd number of 
luminaires, one less than half luminaires are controlled. Photo Control Receptacle operates on the higher system 
voltage entering the pole. If system voltage is 277/480V, then the receptacle operates off of 480V. Photocell 
provided by customer operates on the higher system voltage entering the pole.
5 If customer has voltage drop specifications, contact PSG. Voltage drop on pole power cord due to the pole height 
is not calculated on standard lowering devices. When customer specifications require that the pole power cord 
may not exceed specified voltage drop, with the pole height must be reduced or the gauge of the power cord 
must be increased. Contact PSG.

Production is strictly controlled and follows an extensiveset of instructions established for reproducibility.  Ahomogeneous film of metal a lloy is deposited on a high
grade ceramic body.  The fuse elements are covered by aprotective coating designed for electrical, mechanical andclimatic protection.  The termina tions receive a final pure tin
on nickel plating.The result of the determined pr oduction is verified by an
extensive testing procedure performed on 100 % of the
individual fuses.  Only acce pted products are laid directly
into the paper tape in accordance with IEC 60286-3 .
APPROVALS
The fuses are tested in accordance with the followingstandards:• IEC 60127-1• IEC 60127-4• UL 248-14• IEC 60068 seriesApproval of conformity is indicated by the UMF Logo on thepackage label. Recognition by Underwriter Laboratories Inc.
is indicated by the UL logo on the package label.ASSEMBLY
The fuses are suitable for processing on automatic SMDassembly systems. They are suitable for automaticsoldering using wave, reflow  or vapour phase. The
encapsulation is resistant to all cleaning solvents commonlyused in the electronics indust ry, including alcohols, esters
and aqueous solutions.  The fuses are RoHS compliant, thepure tin plating provides compatibility with lead (Pb)-freeand lead-containing soldering processes.  The immunity ofthe plating against tin whis ker growth has been proven
under extensive testing.  Solder ability is specified for 2 years
after production or re-qualification.  The permitted storage
time is 20 years.All products comply with the JIG 101  list of legal restrictions
on hazardous substances. This includes full compliance with the following directives:• 2000/53/EC End of Vehicle life Directive (ELV) and
Annex II (ELV II)
• 2011/65/EU Restriction of the use of Hazardous
Substances Directive (RoHS)

SOLUTION ENGINEERING FOR NOISE, 
BROADEST LINES OF MATERIALS AND PARTS
E-A-R Specialty Composites provides a wide range of materials
and component options for controlling complex noise, vibration,motion and mechanical shock. Standard components includegrommets, fan mounts, bushings and equipment feet. Thisextensive offering of standard parts will often provide an “off-the-shelf” solution that meets design requirements.
In addition, E-A-R offers the industry’s broadest range of 
engineered elastomer platforms specifically developed toaddress mechanical energy control challenges that are common in today’s complex OEM product designs.
Designers can choose from four standard materials platforms—
ISODAMP C-1000 Series elastomers, ISODAMP C-8002 Series 
elastomers, VersaDamp 2000 Series TPEs and ISOLOSS HD 
thermoset polyurethanes—to obtain precisely the right combination of performance and physical properties.
The ISODAMP, ISOLOSS and VersaDamp material platforms are
highly damped elastomers, exhibiting extremely low reboundcharacteristics. This ensures extremely low amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after impulsive shock or vibration input. 
In addition, the VersaDamp platform offers adjustable damping
and stiffness, enabling the design engineer to custom-tune a part’sdynamic response. VersaDamp TPEs also offer an extended servicetemperature range, making them ideal for portable electronicsand automotive applications.
E-A-R’s ISODAMP C-8002 Series thermoplastic molding material
combines excellent damping performance and mechanicalstrength with compliance to environmental and other highcleanliness specifications, for high performance solutions in a wide variety of molded parts applications.
Additional features and typical applications for each of the
materials platforms are listed at left. More detailed informationon E-A-R’s full line of elastomers is contained in materials summary sheets and technical data sheets available directly from the company, on the Website at www.earsc.com or on the electronics Website at www.earshockandvibe.com.

THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DAMPING
E-A-R damped elastomers offer important advantages over 
poorly damped materials, such as natural and synthetic rubber,silicone and commodity TPEs. These advantages are especiallyimportant when attempting to control noise, shock and vibra-tion in today’s complex and component-dense OEM products. 
Optimized Shock and Vibration Control
Vibration is typically characterized by continuous oscillatory motion
of relatively small amplitude, while shock commonly features a 
relatively large, sudden change in acceleration due to an applieddynamic force. Consequently, vibration and shock considerationsoften place conflicting requirements on an isolation system.
A poorly damped isolator (typically made from natural rubber 
or silicone), that is soft enough for good vibration isolation, may require more sway space for deflection during a shock input than the product’s design can provide. So a stiffer isolatormay be needed to prevent crashing or bottoming out, but thiscould have a negative effect on vibration performance. E-A-R’shighly damped elastomers help mitigate this common conflict.
Traditional practice has dictated that the natural frequency of 
an isolation mount be well below the operating frequency of the vibration source. This tactic seeks to avoid a situation wherethe source’s operational frequency is near the mount’s naturalfrequency, causing excessive amplification of the transmittedvibration. In practice, though, it is often difficult to avoid excitation of the isolation system’s resonance, especially in complex systems that cycle on and off, change speed or produce broadband, multi- frequency vibration. 
With E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, vibration amplification 
is minimized. Figure 1 illustrates how an elastomer’s loss factor (
/H9257m, a measure of hysteretic damping) influences vibration
amplification. E-A-R’s elastomers, with material loss factors near 1.0, exhibit a maximum amplification of only 3 to 5 dB (1.4X to 1.8X). Natural rubber or silicone isolators, with loss factors as low as 0.05, can exhibit excessive amplification as high as 25dB (18X). This reduced amplification minimizes the traditional need for an isolation system with a low naturalfrequency. As a result, a stiffer mount can be used to betteraccommodate shock requirements while still providing the vibration isolation performance necessary for most noise control applications. 
Shock Protection: Reducing Space, Time and Magnitude

to shock input, compared to poorly damped elastomers.
 Dramatically reduced settling time after shock input. 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the loss factor of an isolator 
material can influence shock response (transmitted accelerationand peak deflection). E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, withloss factors near 1.0, provide lower peak acceleration and deflection resulting in a higher degree of shock protection within a smaller package design. Poorly damped elastomersoften require twice as much sway space to provide the samelevel of shock protection. This benefit is critical given the tightspace constraints that are common in today’s smaller portableelectronic devices and component-dense OEM products.
In addition, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, E-A-R elastomers provide
a quick return to equilibrium while the poorly damped system continues to oscillate and flex. Post-shock, resonant oscillation is a primary contributor to electromechanical system performanceloss and component fatigue failure in portable electronic devices.E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers help to reduce these post-shockoscillations, increase product performance and extend product life.

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Predicting E-A-R isolator performance is simple. Just follow the 
instructions below and refer to the grommet data tables andperformance graphs beginning on Page 4. 
DETERMINING DYNAMIC STIFFNESS
Select a candidate ISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet based on your
application parameters—load per isolator, axial (horizontal plate) orradial (vertical plate) orientation, and plate dimensions. Follow thesesteps to determine a grommet’s dynamic stiffness by using the data tableand performance graph for the grommet style you have chosen.
From the data table —Locate the load factor for the chosen grommet
and orientation (axial or radial). Now , divide the  grommet load(lb/grommet) by the load factor. The result is the load ratio.
 To the performance graph —Locate the load ratio value on the
curve (x-axis), and read the resulting stiffness ratio from the y-axis.
 Back to the data table —Multiply this stiffness ratio value by the
stiffness factor. And this is the per grommet stiffness (lb/in).
CORRECTION FOR ELASTOMER FORMULA-
TION AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE
The stiffness calculated from the grommet data tables and performance graphs represents the dynamic stiffness for a C-1002
grommet at 70F (21C). The T emperature/ Formulation CorrectionChart above makes it easy to determine the dynamic stiffness of anyISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet for any operating temperature. 
Simply multiply the correction factor from this chart by the stiffnessjust calculated to get the dynamic stiffness value (lb/in) of the grommetin the material of choice for your operating temperature range.
NATURAL FREQUENCY CALCULATION
Calculations from the grommet data tables and grommet performance
graphs are intended to determine dynamic stiffness values for E-A-Rgrommets. This stiffness data is basic to predicting overall systemresponse and system natural frequency .
The natural frequency of a particular E-A-R grommet can now be
calculated using the following formula:
Fn= 3.13     
√ K ÷ W
WHERE: Fn= Natural frequency of the grommet (Hz)
K = Dynamic stiffness (lb/in)
W = Load per grommet (lb)HOW TO CALCULATE MOUNT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCY FOR ISODAMP AND VERSADAMP ISOLATORS

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Vibration IsolationEXAMPLE CALCULATION: COMPUTER HARD DRIVE
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 (ISODAMP C-1105)
grommets at 100F . Lateral hard drive vibration produces axial grommet deflec-tion (y direction, see Figure 2). W e therefore will utilize the axial mount data forthe stiffness calculation. Four grommets will be used to support the hard drive.T wo grommets are shown in Figure 1 and two are located on the opposite side.
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 1.8
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 
0.375 ÷ 1.8 = 0.208
Use the performance graph to determine the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 
0.208 corresponds to stiffness ratio of 3.0
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1911 lb/in
Effective stiffness is stiffness factor x stiffness ratio: 1911 lb/in x 3 = 5733 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor=0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 5733 lb/in x 0.63 = 3612 lb/in
Natural Frequency Fn= 3.13  √(3612 ÷ 0.375) = 307 Hz
Isolation Performance Calculation
Cross-Over Frequency =  √2    x 307 = 434 Hz
Fd= Resonant Frequencies to avoid in computer housings: 1000 to 2000 Hz.
Frequency Ratio = Fd/Fn= 1000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz & 2000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz = 3.25 & 6.5
Per the graph in Figure 3 using frequency ratios, there will be 0.3 to 0.15

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SHOCK PROTECTION
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 grommets at
100F . The shock input: Half Sine 100G @ 2ms. The shock input creates radialloading of grommets (z direction in Figure 2, Page 11).  Therefore, we willutilize radial mount data for our stiffness calculation. Four grommets areused to support the hard drive (see Figure 1, Page 11).
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 0.9
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 0.375 ÷ 0.9 = 0.417
Use the performance graph to get the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 0.417 
corresponds to stiffness ratio of  1.5
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1153 lb/in 
Effective stiffness will be stiffness factor x stiffness ratio = 1.5 x 1153= 1730 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor= 0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 1730 lb/in x 0.63 = 1090 lb/in
Natural Frequency /H9275n= 1059 rad/sec (167 Hz)
Shock Protection Performance Calculation
Effective time duration for half sine shock is 0.637 x actual duration: 
0.637 x 0.002 sec = 0.00127 sec
T ake natural frequency x effective duration = 1059 rad/sec x 0.00127 sec =
1.35 and find response in Figure 1 using loss factor = 1.0 curve.
T ransmissibility is just slightly less than one. Calculated time response 
(via computer algorithm) in Figure 2 confirms this. Often, this is quiteacceptable where the designer wants to ensure that the system does not amplify shock.
Peak deflection for this system is 0.022 inch as determined from graph 
in Figure 3 using the C-1105 material. A curve is shown for poorly dampedmaterial such as natural rubber ( /H9257
m=0.1). The peak displacement would
then be 0.039 inch which is 77 percent higher than the ISODAMP C-1105material. This graph is valid for 100G, 2ms half sine pulses only .
Additional theory on shock protection calculations can be found in most
shock and vibration handbooks.120

T o meet a wide range of performance and assembly needs, E-A-R offers both
one-piece and two-piece styles of grommets.
One-piece grommets—ribbed and non-ribbed
Here are typical methods for installing one-piece E-A-R grommets in a frameor panel.For use in automated assembly , the preferred method of grommet 
installation is the straight-side or keyhole slot. See Figure 1. This methodaccommodates robotic assembly and is the easiest for manual assembly as well. Using this method, the grommet and the hardware recommended to optimize performance can be installed in a single step, or the hardwarecan be added later. See Figure 2.
For manual assembly without keyhole slots, E-A-R grommets can 
be heated to make them more pliable. They can then more easily be pushed into position in the frame or plate.
Two-piece grommets—bushings and rings
For non-standard-thickness panels or frames, use of two-piece grommets(bushings and rings, or two bushings, as shown in Figure 3) can provide a major installation advantage. T wo-piece grommets eliminate the needfor preheating. The two pieces are installed from opposite sides to accommodate many panel thicknesses.
Hardware
Common hardware, typically used with E-A-R grommets to mechanically limitpreload, is shown in Figure 4. The hardware may include a shoulder bolt withwasher, plastic or metal spacer, sleeve, or locking nuts with bolt and washers.
Optimum performance of vibration and shock is generally achieved with 
5 to 10 percent preloading of E-A-R grommets, especially for ribbed styles. The ideal hardware height to obtain maximum recommended preload canbe calculated from the formula Hardware Height = 0.91 (H) + 0.09(G),
where H is the overall grommet height and Gis the thickness of the mount-
ing plate. See Figure 5.
FAN MOUNTS
Here are typical methods for installing ISODAMP fan mounts. Pull one opening of the “isolation disk” into the hole in the sheet metal. Pull
the fan mount into sheet metal hole in a rotational motion. See Figure 6.Repeat until all the fan mounts are in all the sheet metal holes.
Align all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the fan mounts
while pulling the tip of each individual fan mount through the holes in thefan. See Figure 7./H9278 D

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate two alternate installation methods.Basic Keyhole: Slide fan mounts into the keyholes on the sheet metal. Align
all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the mounts, pullingeach mount through the corresponding hole in the fan. See Figure 8.
Rotational Keyhole: First pull all the fan mounts through the holes on the
fan. Position the fan and mount assembly over the sheet metal. Push all thefan mount bases into the large portion of the keyhole. Rotate the assemblyuntil it locks in place. See Figure 9.

E-A-R fan mounts can be designed with a throw-away tip that breaks awaywith a firm tug after the fan has been installed. See Figure 10. The forcerequired to pull the mount through the fan holes should be less than 1.5 lbf.Break-off force for the tip is about 3 lbf. Figure 11 shows another option—a“double Xmas tree design”— which can accommodate two different flangethicknesses.
For even greater flexibility in manufacturing assembly , fan mounts can be
designed for two-way pull-through installation. See Figure 12. This allows thechoice of pulling the mount through either the fan holes or the sheet metalholes first.
ISOLOSS SANDWICH MOUNTS
As shown in Figure 13, ISOLOSS sandwich mounts can be used to support
loads in either compression or shear, or, as in most cases, some combinationof the two. Here are some installation tips to consider when installing a mount.
Loading conditions vs. stiffness
ISOLOSS HD and VL elastomers are stiffer under compressive load thanunder shear load. Consequently , when the elastomers are used in shear,they cannot be load-rated as highly as when used in compression.
The dynamic shear stiffness generally is between 20 and 30 percent of the
compressive stiffness. Thus, a mount’s natural frequency under compres-sion loading is twice what it is under shear loading. Therefore, a mountcan be used in static compression up to its material strength limits while providing very good isolation of lateral, or shear, vibration.
Deflection in overload conditions
ISOLOSS sandwich mounts are self-snubbing under compressive overload. Asa mount is loaded to its design limit, the effective stiffness begins to increase,thus offsetting excessive deflection under overload conditions. By contrast,overload in the shear direction will increase shear stiffness only slightly . Conse-quently , shear overload is not self-snubbing. The same is true for tensile overload.
This behavior makes a strong case for engineering sandwich mounts to 
be used primarily in compression, especially in cases where occasionaloverload or excessive temperatures may occur. As a rule, sandwichmounts should never be used primarily in ten
sion. If they must be used 
in tension or shear, however, a fail-safe design, e.g., use of a retentionstrap, is especially critical. W

Reduced Frequency Nomograms
The reduced frequency format is the standardmethod for displaying damping material perfor-mance data. To determine dynamic Young’s modu-lus and material loss factor at a given temperatureand frequency, use the following steps.
1) Select the frequency of interest on the right-
hand vertical axis.
2) Follow the selected frequency line horizontally
to the left until the selected diagonal temper-
ature isotherm is intersected.
3) Draw a vertical line up and down through the
frequency/isotherm intersection, intersectingthe dynamic Young’s modulus and materialloss factor curves.
4) Draw horizontal lines from these points to
intersect the left-hand vertical axis.
5) The dynamic Young’s modulus value is read
using the Dynamic Modulus scale and the loss factor from the Loss Factor scale.MATERIAL NOMOGRAMS & PROPERTIES

Fair to PoorResistance DataOther Common Materials E-A-R Highly Damped MaterialsELASTOMER COMPARISON GUIDE
20The data listed in this guide are typical or average values based on tests conducted by independent laboratories or by the manu facturer. They are indicative only of the results obtained in such tests and
should not be considered as guaranteed maximums or minimums. Materials must be tested under actual service to determine their s uitability for a particular purpose.Incorporating preventive measures early in a product’s development
process can help sidestep unwanted noise and vibration, as well as dis-ruptive and destructive shock energy that can affect marketability . Italso can prevent the need to re-engineer, redesign or retool. Retrofittingis rarely as cost-effective as designed-in controls, and may be muchmore costly to implement in the long run.
E-A-R engineers and technicians routinely consult with product design-
ers about materials selection, design configurations, potential problemsand other critical noise, vibration and shock issues while the design is stillon the drawing board. W e don’t supply just materials. W e offer our tech-nical expertise, applications experience and testing capabilities as well.Assistance from an E-A-R applications engineer may entail a quick
phone call, complete in-house lab diagnosis or even a visit to the cus-tomer’s site. Our NO VICON lab can effectively diagnose problems andvalidate our proposed solutions, utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic andanalytical tools. Vibration shakers, drop shock tables, high-speed videoand a hemi-anechoic chamber are just a few of the tools commonly used.
E-A-R also utilizes the latest 3D solid modeling CAD systems—ProE,
CA TIA, SolidW orks and SDRC-Ideas—to examine a customer’s productduring the design stage and to develop custom solutions. Electronictransfer of large files is available through our W ebsites.

0,5xDDAir flo w measurement :
The differential pressure approach compares the static pressure before theinlet nozzle with the static pressure inside the inlet nozzle.Air flow can be calculated on the basis of the differential pressure (differencein pressure of the static pressures) in keeping with the following equation:
V = k .
/H20844/H9004pW V in [m3/h] and /H9004pWin [Pa]
If constant air flow control is used, then the nozzle pressure has to be keptconstant: /H9004p
W= V2:k2
k takes into account the specific nozzle characteristics.
1 or 4 pressure measuring points are spaced along the circumference ofthe inlet nozzle. Connection on the customer side is accomplished via apremounted T tube connector. This tube connector is suited for pneumatichoses with an internal diameter of 4 mm.

SOLUTION ENGINEERING FOR NOISE, 
BROADEST LINES OF MATERIALS AND PARTS
E-A-R Specialty Composites provides a wide range of materials
and component options for controlling complex noise, vibration,motion and mechanical shock. Standard components includegrommets, fan mounts, bushings and equipment feet. Thisextensive offering of standard parts will often provide an “off-the-shelf” solution that meets design requirements.
In addition, E-A-R offers the industry’s broadest range of 
engineered elastomer platforms specifically developed toaddress mechanical energy control challenges that are common in today’s complex OEM product designs.
Designers can choose from four standard materials platforms—
ISODAMP C-1000 Series elastomers, ISODAMP C-8002 Series 
elastomers, VersaDamp 2000 Series TPEs and ISOLOSS HD 
thermoset polyurethanes—to obtain precisely the right combination of performance and physical properties.
The ISODAMP, ISOLOSS and VersaDamp material platforms are
highly damped elastomers, exhibiting extremely low reboundcharacteristics. This ensures extremely low amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after impulsive shock or vibration input. 
In addition, the VersaDamp platform offers adjustable damping
and stiffness, enabling the design engineer to custom-tune a part’sdynamic response. VersaDamp TPEs also offer an extended servicetemperature range, making them ideal for portable electronicsand automotive applications.
E-A-R’s ISODAMP C-8002 Series thermoplastic molding material
combines excellent damping performance and mechanicalstrength with compliance to environmental and other highcleanliness specifications, for high performance solutions in a wide variety of molded parts applications.
Additional features and typical applications for each of the
materials platforms are listed at left. More detailed informationon E-A-R’s full line of elastomers is contained in materials summary sheets and technical data sheets available directly from the company, on the Website at www.earsc.com or on the electronics Website at www.earshockandvibe.com.

THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DAMPING
E-A-R damped elastomers offer important advantages over 
poorly damped materials, such as natural and synthetic rubber,silicone and commodity TPEs. These advantages are especiallyimportant when attempting to control noise, shock and vibra-tion in today’s complex and component-dense OEM products. 
Optimized Shock and Vibration Control
Vibration is typically characterized by continuous oscillatory motion
of relatively small amplitude, while shock commonly features a 
relatively large, sudden change in acceleration due to an applieddynamic force. Consequently, vibration and shock considerationsoften place conflicting requirements on an isolation system.
A poorly damped isolator (typically made from natural rubber 
or silicone), that is soft enough for good vibration isolation, may require more sway space for deflection during a shock input than the product’s design can provide. So a stiffer isolatormay be needed to prevent crashing or bottoming out, but thiscould have a negative effect on vibration performance. E-A-R’shighly damped elastomers help mitigate this common conflict.
Traditional practice has dictated that the natural frequency of 
an isolation mount be well below the operating frequency of the vibration source. This tactic seeks to avoid a situation wherethe source’s operational frequency is near the mount’s naturalfrequency, causing excessive amplification of the transmittedvibration. In practice, though, it is often difficult to avoid excitation of the isolation system’s resonance, especially in complex systems that cycle on and off, change speed or produce broadband, multi- frequency vibration. 
With E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, vibration amplification 
is minimized. Figure 1 illustrates how an elastomer’s loss factor (
/H9257m, a measure of hysteretic damping) influences vibration
amplification. E-A-R’s elastomers, with material loss factors near 1.0, exhibit a maximum amplification of only 3 to 5 dB (1.4X to 1.8X). Natural rubber or silicone isolators, with loss factors as low as 0.05, can exhibit excessive amplification as high as 25dB (18X). This reduced amplification minimizes the traditional need for an isolation system with a low naturalfrequency. As a result, a stiffer mount can be used to betteraccommodate shock requirements while still providing the vibration isolation performance necessary for most noise control applications. 
Shock Protection: Reducing Space, Time and Magnitude

ISODAMP ResponseFigure 3 Lower peak acceleration ( Gs) and displacement (sway) response
to shock input, compared to poorly damped elastomers.
 Dramatically reduced settling time after shock input. 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the loss factor of an isolator 
material can influence shock response (transmitted accelerationand peak deflection). E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, withloss factors near 1.0, provide lower peak acceleration and deflection resulting in a higher degree of shock protection within a smaller package design. Poorly damped elastomersoften require twice as much sway space to provide the samelevel of shock protection. This benefit is critical given the tightspace constraints that are common in today’s smaller portableelectronic devices and component-dense OEM products.
In addition, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, E-A-R elastomers provide
a quick return to equilibrium while the poorly damped system continues to oscillate and flex. Post-shock, resonant oscillation is a primary contributor to electromechanical system performanceloss and component fatigue failure in portable electronic devices.E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers help to reduce these post-shockoscillations, increase product performance and extend product life.

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Predicting E-A-R isolator performance is simple. Just follow the 
instructions below and refer to the grommet data tables andperformance graphs beginning on Page 4. 
DETERMINING DYNAMIC STIFFNESS
Select a candidate ISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet based on your
application parameters—load per isolator, axial (horizontal plate) orradial (vertical plate) orientation, and plate dimensions. Follow thesesteps to determine a grommet’s dynamic stiffness by using the data tableand performance graph for the grommet style you have chosen.
From the data table —Locate the load factor for the chosen grommet
and orientation (axial or radial). Now , divide the  grommet load(lb/grommet) by the load factor. The result is the load ratio.
 To the performance graph —Locate the load ratio value on the
curve (x-axis), and read the resulting stiffness ratio from the y-axis.
 Back to the data table —Multiply this stiffness ratio value by the
stiffness factor. And this is the per grommet stiffness (lb/in).
CORRECTION FOR ELASTOMER FORMULA-
TION AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE
The stiffness calculated from the grommet data tables and performance graphs represents the dynamic stiffness for a C-1002
grommet at 70F (21C). The T emperature/ Formulation CorrectionChart above makes it easy to determine the dynamic stiffness of anyISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet for any operating temperature. 
Simply multiply the correction factor from this chart by the stiffnessjust calculated to get the dynamic stiffness value (lb/in) of the grommetin the material of choice for your operating temperature range.
NATURAL FREQUENCY CALCULATION
Calculations from the grommet data tables and grommet performance
graphs are intended to determine dynamic stiffness values for E-A-Rgrommets. This stiffness data is basic to predicting overall systemresponse and system natural frequency .
The natural frequency of a particular E-A-R grommet can now be
calculated using the following formula:
Fn= 3.13     
√ K ÷ W
WHERE: Fn= Natural frequency of the grommet (Hz)
K = Dynamic stiffness (lb/in)
W = Load per grommet (lb)HOW TO CALCULATE MOUNT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCY FOR ISODAMP AND VERSADAMP ISOLATORS

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Vibration IsolationEXAMPLE CALCULATION: COMPUTER HARD DRIVE
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 (ISODAMP C-1105)
grommets at 100F . Lateral hard drive vibration produces axial grommet deflec-tion (y direction, see Figure 2). W e therefore will utilize the axial mount data forthe stiffness calculation. Four grommets will be used to support the hard drive.T wo grommets are shown in Figure 1 and two are located on the opposite side.
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 1.8
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 
0.375 ÷ 1.8 = 0.208
Use the performance graph to determine the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 
0.208 corresponds to stiffness ratio of 3.0
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1911 lb/in
Effective stiffness is stiffness factor x stiffness ratio: 1911 lb/in x 3 = 5733 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor=0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 5733 lb/in x 0.63 = 3612 lb/in
Natural Frequency Fn= 3.13  √(3612 ÷ 0.375) = 307 Hz
Isolation Performance Calculation
Cross-Over Frequency =  √2    x 307 = 434 Hz
Fd= Resonant Frequencies to avoid in computer housings: 1000 to 2000 Hz.
Frequency Ratio = Fd/Fn= 1000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz & 2000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz = 3.25 & 6.5
Per the graph in Figure 3 using frequency ratios, there will be 0.3 to 0.15
T ransmissibility (or 70 percent to 85 percent isolation) in that range
T o estimate peak transmissibility as shown in Figure 3, use loss factor from 
the material nomogram (Figure 4) and equation at left. ( /H9257m=0.8, T max=1.6)

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SHOCK PROTECTION
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 grommets at
100F . The shock input: Half Sine 100G @ 2ms. The shock input creates radialloading of grommets (z direction in Figure 2, Page 11).  Therefore, we willutilize radial mount data for our stiffness calculation. Four grommets areused to support the hard drive (see Figure 1, Page 11).
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 0.9
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 0.375 ÷ 0.9 = 0.417
Use the performance graph to get the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 0.417 
corresponds to stiffness ratio of  1.5
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1153 lb/in 
Effective stiffness will be stiffness factor x stiffness ratio = 1.5 x 1153= 1730 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor= 0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 1730 lb/in x 0.63 = 1090 lb/in
Natural Frequency /H9275n= 1059 rad/sec (167 Hz)
Shock Protection Performance Calculation
Effective time duration for half sine shock is 0.637 x actual duration: 
0.637 x 0.002 sec = 0.00127 sec
T ake natural frequency x effective duration = 1059 rad/sec x 0.00127 sec =
1.35 and find response in Figure 1 using loss factor = 1.0 curve.
T ransmissibility is just slightly less than one. Calculated time response 
(via computer algorithm) in Figure 2 confirms this. Often, this is quiteacceptable where the designer wants to ensure that the system does not amplify shock.
Peak deflection for this system is 0.022 inch as determined from graph 
in Figure 3 using the C-1105 material. A curve is shown for poorly dampedmaterial such as natural rubber ( /H9257
m=0.1). The peak displacement would
then be 0.039 inch which is 77 percent higher than the ISODAMP C-1105material. This graph is valid for 100G, 2ms half sine pulses only .
Additional theory on shock protection calculations can be found in most
shock and vibration handbooks.120

E-mail: solutions@earsc.com Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  GROMMETS
T o meet a wide range of performance and assembly needs, E-A-R offers both
one-piece and two-piece styles of grommets.
One-piece grommets—ribbed and non-ribbed
Here are typical methods for installing one-piece E-A-R grommets in a frameor panel.For use in automated assembly , the preferred method of grommet 
installation is the straight-side or keyhole slot. See Figure 1. This methodaccommodates robotic assembly and is the easiest for manual assembly as well. Using this method, the grommet and the hardware recommended to optimize performance can be installed in a single step, or the hardwarecan be added later. See Figure 2.
For manual assembly without keyhole slots, E-A-R grommets can 
be heated to make them more pliable. They can then more easily be pushed into position in the frame or plate.
Two-piece grommets—bushings and rings
For non-standard-thickness panels or frames, use of two-piece grommets(bushings and rings, or two bushings, as shown in Figure 3) can provide a major installation advantage. T wo-piece grommets eliminate the needfor preheating. The two pieces are installed from opposite sides to accommodate many panel thicknesses.
Hardware
Common hardware, typically used with E-A-R grommets to mechanically limitpreload, is shown in Figure 4. The hardware may include a shoulder bolt withwasher, plastic or metal spacer, sleeve, or locking nuts with bolt and washers.
Optimum performance of vibration and shock is generally achieved with 
5 to 10 percent preloading of E-A-R grommets, especially for ribbed styles. The ideal hardware height to obtain maximum recommended preload canbe calculated from the formula Hardware Height = 0.91 (H) + 0.09(G),
where H is the overall grommet height and Gis the thickness of the mount-
ing plate. See Figure 5.
FAN MOUNTS
Here are typical methods for installing ISODAMP fan mounts. Pull one opening of the “isolation disk” into the hole in the sheet metal. Pull
the fan mount into sheet metal hole in a rotational motion. See Figure 6.Repeat until all the fan mounts are in all the sheet metal holes.
Align all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the fan mounts
while pulling the tip of each individual fan mount through the holes in thefan. See Figure 7./H9278 D

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Alternate fan mount installations
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate two alternate installation methods.Basic Keyhole: Slide fan mounts into the keyholes on the sheet metal. Align
all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the mounts, pullingeach mount through the corresponding hole in the fan. See Figure 8.
Rotational Keyhole: First pull all the fan mounts through the holes on the
fan. Position the fan and mount assembly over the sheet metal. Push all thefan mount bases into the large portion of the keyhole. Rotate the assemblyuntil it locks in place. See Figure 9.

E-A-R fan mounts can be designed with a throw-away tip that breaks awaywith a firm tug after the fan has been installed. See Figure 10. The forcerequired to pull the mount through the fan holes should be less than 1.5 lbf.Break-off force for the tip is about 3 lbf. Figure 11 shows another option—a“double Xmas tree design”— which can accommodate two different flangethicknesses.
For even greater flexibility in manufacturing assembly , fan mounts can be
designed for two-way pull-through installation. See Figure 12. This allows thechoice of pulling the mount through either the fan holes or the sheet metalholes first.
ISOLOSS SANDWICH MOUNTS
As shown in Figure 13, ISOLOSS sandwich mounts can be used to support
loads in either compression or shear, or, as in most cases, some combinationof the two. Here are some installation tips to consider when installing a mount.
Loading conditions vs. stiffness
ISOLOSS HD and VL elastomers are stiffer under compressive load thanunder shear load. Consequently , when the elastomers are used in shear,they cannot be load-rated as highly as when used in compression.
The dynamic shear stiffness generally is between 20 and 30 percent of the
compressive stiffness. Thus, a mount’s natural frequency under compres-sion loading is twice what it is under shear loading. Therefore, a mountcan be used in static compression up to its material strength limits while providing very good isolation of lateral, or shear, vibration.
Deflection in overload conditions
ISOLOSS sandwich mounts are self-snubbing under compressive overload. Asa mount is loaded to its design limit, the effective stiffness begins to increase,thus offsetting excessive deflection under overload conditions. By contrast,overload in the shear direction will increase shear stiffness only slightly . Conse-quently , shear overload is not self-snubbing. The same is true for tensile overload.
This behavior makes a strong case for engineering sandwich mounts to 
be used primarily in compression, especially in cases where occasionaloverload or excessive temperatures may occur. As a rule, sandwichmounts should never be used primarily in ten
sion. If they must be used 
in tension or shear, however, a fail-safe design, e.g., use of a retentionstrap, is especially critical. W

Reduced Frequency Nomograms
The reduced frequency format is the standardmethod for displaying damping material perfor-mance data. To determine dynamic Young’s modu-lus and material loss factor at a given temperatureand frequency, use the following steps.
1) Select the frequency of interest on the right-
hand vertical axis.
2) Follow the selected frequency line horizontally
to the left until the selected diagonal temper-
ature isotherm is intersected.
3) Draw a vertical line up and down through the
frequency/isotherm intersection, intersectingthe dynamic Young’s modulus and materialloss factor curves.
4) Draw horizontal lines from these points to
intersect the left-hand vertical axis.
5) The dynamic Young’s modulus value is read
using the Dynamic Modulus scale and the loss factor from the Loss Factor scale.MATERIAL NOMOGRAMS & PROPERTIES

20The data listed in this guide are typical or average values based on tests conducted by independent laboratories or by the manu facturer. They are indicative only of the results obtained in such tests and
should not be considered as guaranteed maximums or minimums. Materials must be tested under actual service to determine their s uitability for a particular purpose.Incorporating preventive measures early in a product’s development
process can help sidestep unwanted noise and vibration, as well as dis-ruptive and destructive shock energy that can affect marketability . Italso can prevent the need to re-engineer, redesign or retool. Retrofittingis rarely as cost-effective as designed-in controls, and may be muchmore costly to implement in the long run.
E-A-R engineers and technicians routinely consult with product design-
ers about materials selection, design configurations, potential problemsand other critical noise, vibration and shock issues while the design is stillon the drawing board. W e don’t supply just materials. W e offer our tech-nical expertise, applications experience and testing capabilities as well.Assistance from an E-A-R applications engineer may entail a quick
phone call, complete in-house lab diagnosis or even a visit to the cus-tomer’s site. Our NO VICON lab can effectively diagnose problems andvalidate our proposed solutions, utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic andanalytical tools. Vibration shakers, drop shock tables, high-speed videoand a hemi-anechoic chamber are just a few of the tools commonly used.
E-A-R also utilizes the latest 3D solid modeling CAD systems—ProE,

E-A-R Specialty Composites provides a wide range of materials
and component options for controlling complex noise, vibration,motion and mechanical shock. Standard components includegrommets, fan mounts, bushings and equipment feet. Thisextensive offering of standard parts will often provide an “off-the-shelf” solution that meets design requirements.
In addition, E-A-R offers the industry’s broadest range of 
engineered elastomer platforms specifically developed toaddress mechanical energy control challenges that are common in today’s complex OEM product designs.
Designers can choose from four standard materials platforms—
ISODAMP C-1000 Series elastomers, ISODAMP C-8002 Series 
elastomers, VersaDamp 2000 Series TPEs and ISOLOSS HD 
thermoset polyurethanes—to obtain precisely the right combination of performance and physical properties.
The ISODAMP, ISOLOSS and VersaDamp material platforms are
highly damped elastomers, exhibiting extremely low reboundcharacteristics. This ensures extremely low amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after impulsive shock or vibration input. 
In addition, the VersaDamp platform offers adjustable damping
and stiffness, enabling the design engineer to custom-tune a part’sdynamic response. VersaDamp TPEs also offer an extended servicetemperature range, making them ideal for portable electronicsand automotive applications.
E-A-R’s ISODAMP C-8002 Series thermoplastic molding material
combines excellent damping performance and mechanicalstrength with compliance to environmental and other highcleanliness specifications, for high performance solutions in a wide variety of molded parts applications.
Additional features and typical applications for each of the
materials platforms are listed at left. More detailed informationon E-A-R’s full line of elastomers is contained in materials summary sheets and technical data sheets available directly from the company, on the Website at www.earsc.com or on the electronics Website at www.earshockandvibe.com.

THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DAMPING
E-A-R damped elastomers offer important advantages over 
poorly damped materials, such as natural and synthetic rubber,silicone and commodity TPEs. These advantages are especiallyimportant when attempting to control noise, shock and vibra-tion in today’s complex and component-dense OEM products. 
Optimized Shock and Vibration Control
Vibration is typically characterized by continuous oscillatory motion
of relatively small amplitude, while shock commonly features a 
relatively large, sudden change in acceleration due to an applieddynamic force. Consequently, vibration and shock considerationsoften place conflicting requirements on an isolation system.
A poorly damped isolator (typically made from natural rubber 
or silicone), that is soft enough for good vibration isolation, may require more sway space for deflection during a shock input than the product’s design can provide. So a stiffer isolatormay be needed to prevent crashing or bottoming out, but thiscould have a negative effect on vibration performance. E-A-R’shighly damped elastomers help mitigate this common conflict.
Traditional practice has dictated that the natural frequency of 
an isolation mount be well below the operating frequency of the vibration source. This tactic seeks to avoid a situation wherethe source’s operational frequency is near the mount’s naturalfrequency, causing excessive amplification of the transmittedvibration. In practice, though, it is often difficult to avoid excitation of the isolation system’s resonance, especially in complex systems that cycle on and off, change speed or produce broadband, multi- frequency vibration. 
With E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, vibration amplification 
is minimized. Figure 1 illustrates how an elastomer’s loss factor (
/H9257m, a measure of hysteretic damping) influences vibration
amplification. E-A-R’s elastomers, with material loss factors near 1.0, exhibit a maximum amplification of only 3 to 5 dB (1.4X to 1.8X). Natural rubber or silicone isolators, with loss factors as low as 0.05, can exhibit excessive amplification as high as 25dB (18X). This reduced amplification minimizes the traditional need for an isolation system with a low naturalfrequency. As a result, a stiffer mount can be used to betteraccommodate shock requirements while still providing the vibration isolation performance necessary for most noise control applications. 
Shock Protection: Reducing Space, Time and Magnitude
For most OEM shock protection applications, E-A-R’s highlydamped elastomers offer two important advantages:

ISODAMP ResponseFigure 3 Lower peak acceleration ( Gs) and displacement (sway) response
to shock input, compared to poorly damped elastomers.
 Dramatically reduced settling time after shock input. 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the loss factor of an isolator 
material can influence shock response (transmitted accelerationand peak deflection). E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, withloss factors near 1.0, provide lower peak acceleration and deflection resulting in a higher degree of shock protection within a smaller package design. Poorly damped elastomersoften require twice as much sway space to provide the samelevel of shock protection. This benefit is critical given the tightspace constraints that are common in today’s smaller portableelectronic devices and component-dense OEM products.
In addition, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, E-A-R elastomers provide
a quick return to equilibrium while the poorly damped system continues to oscillate and flex. Post-shock, resonant oscillation is a primary contributor to electromechanical system performanceloss and component fatigue failure in portable electronic devices.E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers help to reduce these post-shockoscillations, increase product performance and extend product life.

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Predicting E-A-R isolator performance is simple. Just follow the 
instructions below and refer to the grommet data tables andperformance graphs beginning on Page 4. 
DETERMINING DYNAMIC STIFFNESS
Select a candidate ISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet based on your
application parameters—load per isolator, axial (horizontal plate) orradial (vertical plate) orientation, and plate dimensions. Follow thesesteps to determine a grommet’s dynamic stiffness by using the data tableand performance graph for the grommet style you have chosen.
From the data table —Locate the load factor for the chosen grommet
and orientation (axial or radial). Now , divide the  grommet load(lb/grommet) by the load factor. The result is the load ratio.
 To the performance graph —Locate the load ratio value on the
curve (x-axis), and read the resulting stiffness ratio from the y-axis.
 Back to the data table —Multiply this stiffness ratio value by the
stiffness factor. And this is the per grommet stiffness (lb/in).
CORRECTION FOR ELASTOMER FORMULA-
TION AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE
The stiffness calculated from the grommet data tables and performance graphs represents the dynamic stiffness for a C-1002
grommet at 70F (21C). The T emperature/ Formulation CorrectionChart above makes it easy to determine the dynamic stiffness of anyISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet for any operating temperature. 
Simply multiply the correction factor from this chart by the stiffnessjust calculated to get the dynamic stiffness value (lb/in) of the grommetin the material of choice for your operating temperature range.
NATURAL FREQUENCY CALCULATION
Calculations from the grommet data tables and grommet performance
graphs are intended to determine dynamic stiffness values for E-A-Rgrommets. This stiffness data is basic to predicting overall systemresponse and system natural frequency .
The natural frequency of a particular E-A-R grommet can now be
calculated using the following formula:
Fn= 3.13     
√ K ÷ W
WHERE: Fn= Natural frequency of the grommet (Hz)
K = Dynamic stiffness (lb/in)
W = Load per grommet (lb)HOW TO CALCULATE MOUNT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCY FOR ISODAMP AND VERSADAMP ISOLATORS

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Vibration IsolationEXAMPLE CALCULATION: COMPUTER HARD DRIVE
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 (ISODAMP C-1105)
grommets at 100F . Lateral hard drive vibration produces axial grommet deflec-tion (y direction, see Figure 2). W e therefore will utilize the axial mount data forthe stiffness calculation. Four grommets will be used to support the hard drive.T wo grommets are shown in Figure 1 and two are located on the opposite side.
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 1.8
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 
0.375 ÷ 1.8 = 0.208
Use the performance graph to determine the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 
0.208 corresponds to stiffness ratio of 3.0
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1911 lb/in
Effective stiffness is stiffness factor x stiffness ratio: 1911 lb/in x 3 = 5733 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor=0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 5733 lb/in x 0.63 = 3612 lb/in
Natural Frequency Fn= 3.13  √(3612 ÷ 0.375) = 307 Hz
Isolation Performance Calculation
Cross-Over Frequency =  √2    x 307 = 434 Hz
Fd= Resonant Frequencies to avoid in computer housings: 1000 to 2000 Hz.
Frequency Ratio = Fd/Fn= 1000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz & 2000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz = 3.25 & 6.5
Per the graph in Figure 3 using frequency ratios, there will be 0.3 to 0.15
T ransmissibility (or 70 percent to 85 percent isolation) in that range
T o estimate peak transmissibility as shown in Figure 3, use loss factor from

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SHOCK PROTECTION
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 grommets at
100F . The shock input: Half Sine 100G @ 2ms. The shock input creates radialloading of grommets (z direction in Figure 2, Page 11).  Therefore, we willutilize radial mount data for our stiffness calculation. Four grommets areused to support the hard drive (see Figure 1, Page 11).
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 0.9
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 0.375 ÷ 0.9 = 0.417
Use the performance graph to get the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 0.417 
corresponds to stiffness ratio of  1.5
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1153 lb/in 
Effective stiffness will be stiffness factor x stiffness ratio = 1.5 x 1153= 1730 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor= 0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 1730 lb/in x 0.63 = 1090 lb/in
Natural Frequency /H9275n= 1059 rad/sec (167 Hz)
Shock Protection Performance Calculation
Effective time duration for half sine shock is 0.637 x actual duration: 
0.637 x 0.002 sec = 0.00127 sec
T ake natural frequency x effective duration = 1059 rad/sec x 0.00127 sec =
1.35 and find response in Figure 1 using loss factor = 1.0 curve.
T ransmissibility is just slightly less than one. Calculated time response 
(via computer algorithm) in Figure 2 confirms this. Often, this is quiteacceptable where the designer wants to ensure that the system does not amplify shock.
Peak deflection for this system is 0.022 inch as determined from graph 
in Figure 3 using the C-1105 material. A curve is shown for poorly dampedmaterial such as natural rubber ( /H9257
m=0.1). The peak displacement would
then be 0.039 inch which is 77 percent higher than the ISODAMP C-1105material. This graph is valid for 100G, 2ms half sine pulses only .
Additional theory on shock protection calculations can be found in most
shock and vibration handbooks.120

E-mail: solutions@earsc.com Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  GROMMETS
T o meet a wide range of performance and assembly needs, E-A-R offers both
one-piece and two-piece styles of grommets.
One-piece grommets—ribbed and non-ribbed
Here are typical methods for installing one-piece E-A-R grommets in a frameor panel.For use in automated assembly , the preferred method of grommet 
installation is the straight-side or keyhole slot. See Figure 1. This methodaccommodates robotic assembly and is the easiest for manual assembly as well. Using this method, the grommet and the hardware recommended to optimize performance can be installed in a single step, or the hardwarecan be added later. See Figure 2.
For manual assembly without keyhole slots, E-A-R grommets can 
be heated to make them more pliable. They can then more easily be pushed into position in the frame or plate.
Two-piece grommets—bushings and rings
For non-standard-thickness panels or frames, use of two-piece grommets(bushings and rings, or two bushings, as shown in Figure 3) can provide a major installation advantage. T wo-piece grommets eliminate the needfor preheating. The two pieces are installed from opposite sides to accommodate many panel thicknesses.
Hardware
Common hardware, typically used with E-A-R grommets to mechanically limitpreload, is shown in Figure 4. The hardware may include a shoulder bolt withwasher, plastic or metal spacer, sleeve, or locking nuts with bolt and washers.
Optimum performance of vibration and shock is generally achieved with 
5 to 10 percent preloading of E-A-R grommets, especially for ribbed styles. The ideal hardware height to obtain maximum recommended preload canbe calculated from the formula Hardware Height = 0.91 (H) + 0.09(G),
where H is the overall grommet height and Gis the thickness of the mount-
ing plate. See Figure 5.
FAN MOUNTS
Here are typical methods for installing ISODAMP fan mounts. Pull one opening of the “isolation disk” into the hole in the sheet metal. Pull
the fan mount into sheet metal hole in a rotational motion. See Figure 6.Repeat until all the fan mounts are in all the sheet metal holes.
Align all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the fan mounts
while pulling the tip of each individual fan mount through the holes in thefan. See Figure 7./H9278 D

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate two alternate installation methods.Basic Keyhole: Slide fan mounts into the keyholes on the sheet metal. Align
all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the mounts, pullingeach mount through the corresponding hole in the fan. See Figure 8.
Rotational Keyhole: First pull all the fan mounts through the holes on the
fan. Position the fan and mount assembly over the sheet metal. Push all thefan mount bases into the large portion of the keyhole. Rotate the assemblyuntil it locks in place. See Figure 9.

E-A-R fan mounts can be designed with a throw-away tip that breaks awaywith a firm tug after the fan has been installed. See Figure 10. The forcerequired to pull the mount through the fan holes should be less than 1.5 lbf.Break-off force for the tip is about 3 lbf. Figure 11 shows another option—a“double Xmas tree design”— which can accommodate two different flangethicknesses.
For even greater flexibility in manufacturing assembly , fan mounts can be
designed for two-way pull-through installation. See Figure 12. This allows thechoice of pulling the mount through either the fan holes or the sheet metalholes first.
ISOLOSS SANDWICH MOUNTS
As shown in Figure 13, ISOLOSS sandwich mounts can be used to support
loads in either compression or shear, or, as in most cases, some combinationof the two. Here are some installation tips to consider when installing a mount.
Loading conditions vs. stiffness
ISOLOSS HD and VL elastomers are stiffer under compressive load thanunder shear load. Consequently , when the elastomers are used in shear,they cannot be load-rated as highly as when used in compression.
The dynamic shear stiffness generally is between 20 and 30 percent of the
compressive stiffness. Thus, a mount’s natural frequency under compres-sion loading is twice what it is under shear loading. Therefore, a mountcan be used in static compression up to its material strength limits while providing very good isolation of lateral, or shear, vibration.
Deflection in overload conditions
ISOLOSS sandwich mounts are self-snubbing under compressive overload. Asa mount is loaded to its design limit, the effective stiffness begins to increase,thus offsetting excessive deflection under overload conditions. By contrast,overload in the shear direction will increase shear stiffness only slightly . Conse-quently , shear overload is not self-snubbing. The same is true for tensile overload.
This behavior makes a strong case for engineering sandwich mounts to 
be used primarily in compression, especially in cases where occasionaloverload or excessive temperatures may occur. As a rule, sandwichmounts should never be used primarily in ten
sion. If they must be used 
in tension or shear, however, a fail-safe design, e.g., use of a retentionstrap, is especially critical. W

Reduced Frequency Nomograms
The reduced frequency format is the standardmethod for displaying damping material perfor-mance data. To determine dynamic Young’s modu-lus and material loss factor at a given temperatureand frequency, use the following steps.
1) Select the frequency of interest on the right-
hand vertical axis.
2) Follow the selected frequency line horizontally
to the left until the selected diagonal temper-
ature isotherm is intersected.
3) Draw a vertical line up and down through the
frequency/isotherm intersection, intersectingthe dynamic Young’s modulus and materialloss factor curves.
4) Draw horizontal lines from these points to
intersect the left-hand vertical axis.
5) The dynamic Young’s modulus value is read
using the Dynamic Modulus scale and the loss factor from the Loss Factor scale.MATERIAL NOMOGRAMS & PROPERTIES

20The data listed in this guide are typical or average values based on tests conducted by independent laboratories or by the manu facturer. They are indicative only of the results obtained in such tests and
should not be considered as guaranteed maximums or minimums. Materials must be tested under actual service to determine their s uitability for a particular purpose.Incorporating preventive measures early in a product’s development
process can help sidestep unwanted noise and vibration, as well as dis-ruptive and destructive shock energy that can affect marketability . Italso can prevent the need to re-engineer, redesign or retool. Retrofittingis rarely as cost-effective as designed-in controls, and may be muchmore costly to implement in the long run.
E-A-R engineers and technicians routinely consult with product design-
ers about materials selection, design configurations, potential problemsand other critical noise, vibration and shock issues while the design is stillon the drawing board. W e don’t supply just materials. W e offer our tech-nical expertise, applications experience and testing capabilities as well.Assistance from an E-A-R applications engineer may entail a quick
phone call, complete in-house lab diagnosis or even a visit to the cus-tomer’s site. Our NO VICON lab can effectively diagnose problems andvalidate our proposed solutions, utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic andanalytical tools. Vibration shakers, drop shock tables, high-speed videoand a hemi-anechoic chamber are just a few of the tools commonly used.
E-A-R also utilizes the latest 3D solid modeling CAD systems—ProE,
CA TIA, SolidW orks and SDRC-Ideas—to examine a customer’s productduring the design stage and to develop custom solutions. Electronictransfer of large files is available through our W ebsites.

and component options for controlling complex noise, vibration,motion and mechanical shock. Standard components includegrommets, fan mounts, bushings and equipment feet. Thisextensive offering of standard parts will often provide an “off-the-shelf” solution that meets design requirements.
In addition, E-A-R offers the industry’s broadest range of 
engineered elastomer platforms specifically developed toaddress mechanical energy control challenges that are common in today’s complex OEM product designs.
Designers can choose from four standard materials platforms—
ISODAMP C-1000 Series elastomers, ISODAMP C-8002 Series 
elastomers, VersaDamp 2000 Series TPEs and ISOLOSS HD 
thermoset polyurethanes—to obtain precisely the right combination of performance and physical properties.
The ISODAMP, ISOLOSS and VersaDamp material platforms are
highly damped elastomers, exhibiting extremely low reboundcharacteristics. This ensures extremely low amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after impulsive shock or vibration input. 
In addition, the VersaDamp platform offers adjustable damping
and stiffness, enabling the design engineer to custom-tune a part’sdynamic response. VersaDamp TPEs also offer an extended servicetemperature range, making them ideal for portable electronicsand automotive applications.
E-A-R’s ISODAMP C-8002 Series thermoplastic molding material
combines excellent damping performance and mechanicalstrength with compliance to environmental and other highcleanliness specifications, for high performance solutions in a wide variety of molded parts applications.
Additional features and typical applications for each of the
materials platforms are listed at left. More detailed informationon E-A-R’s full line of elastomers is contained in materials summary sheets and technical data sheets available directly from the company, on the Website at www.earsc.com or on the electronics Website at www.earshockandvibe.com.

THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DAMPING
E-A-R damped elastomers offer important advantages over 
poorly damped materials, such as natural and synthetic rubber,silicone and commodity TPEs. These advantages are especiallyimportant when attempting to control noise, shock and vibra-tion in today’s complex and component-dense OEM products. 
Optimized Shock and Vibration Control
Vibration is typically characterized by continuous oscillatory motion
of relatively small amplitude, while shock commonly features a 
relatively large, sudden change in acceleration due to an applieddynamic force. Consequently, vibration and shock considerationsoften place conflicting requirements on an isolation system.
A poorly damped isolator (typically made from natural rubber 
or silicone), that is soft enough for good vibration isolation, may require more sway space for deflection during a shock input than the product’s design can provide. So a stiffer isolatormay be needed to prevent crashing or bottoming out, but thiscould have a negative effect on vibration performance. E-A-R’shighly damped elastomers help mitigate this common conflict.
Traditional practice has dictated that the natural frequency of 
an isolation mount be well below the operating frequency of the vibration source. This tactic seeks to avoid a situation wherethe source’s operational frequency is near the mount’s naturalfrequency, causing excessive amplification of the transmittedvibration. In practice, though, it is often difficult to avoid excitation of the isolation system’s resonance, especially in complex systems that cycle on and off, change speed or produce broadband, multi- frequency vibration. 
With E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, vibration amplification 
is minimized. Figure 1 illustrates how an elastomer’s loss factor (
/H9257m, a measure of hysteretic damping) influences vibration
amplification. E-A-R’s elastomers, with material loss factors near 1.0, exhibit a maximum amplification of only 3 to 5 dB (1.4X to 1.8X). Natural rubber or silicone isolators, with loss factors as low as 0.05, can exhibit excessive amplification as high as 25dB (18X). This reduced amplification minimizes the traditional need for an isolation system with a low naturalfrequency. As a result, a stiffer mount can be used to betteraccommodate shock requirements while still providing the vibration isolation performance necessary for most noise control applications. 
Shock Protection: Reducing Space, Time and Magnitude
For most OEM shock protection applications, E-A-R’s highlydamped elastomers offer two important advantages:

ISODAMP ResponseFigure 3 Lower peak acceleration ( Gs) and displacement (sway) response
to shock input, compared to poorly damped elastomers.
 Dramatically reduced settling time after shock input. 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the loss factor of an isolator 
material can influence shock response (transmitted accelerationand peak deflection). E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, withloss factors near 1.0, provide lower peak acceleration and deflection resulting in a higher degree of shock protection within a smaller package design. Poorly damped elastomersoften require twice as much sway space to provide the samelevel of shock protection. This benefit is critical given the tightspace constraints that are common in today’s smaller portableelectronic devices and component-dense OEM products.
In addition, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, E-A-R elastomers provide
a quick return to equilibrium while the poorly damped system continues to oscillate and flex. Post-shock, resonant oscillation is a primary contributor to electromechanical system performanceloss and component fatigue failure in portable electronic devices.E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers help to reduce these post-shockoscillations, increase product performance and extend product life.

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Predicting E-A-R isolator performance is simple. Just follow the 
instructions below and refer to the grommet data tables andperformance graphs beginning on Page 4. 
DETERMINING DYNAMIC STIFFNESS
Select a candidate ISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet based on your
application parameters—load per isolator, axial (horizontal plate) orradial (vertical plate) orientation, and plate dimensions. Follow thesesteps to determine a grommet’s dynamic stiffness by using the data tableand performance graph for the grommet style you have chosen.
From the data table —Locate the load factor for the chosen grommet
and orientation (axial or radial). Now , divide the  grommet load(lb/grommet) by the load factor. The result is the load ratio.
 To the performance graph —Locate the load ratio value on the
curve (x-axis), and read the resulting stiffness ratio from the y-axis.
 Back to the data table —Multiply this stiffness ratio value by the
stiffness factor. And this is the per grommet stiffness (lb/in).
CORRECTION FOR ELASTOMER FORMULA-
TION AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE
The stiffness calculated from the grommet data tables and performance graphs represents the dynamic stiffness for a C-1002
grommet at 70F (21C). The T emperature/ Formulation CorrectionChart above makes it easy to determine the dynamic stiffness of anyISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet for any operating temperature. 
Simply multiply the correction factor from this chart by the stiffnessjust calculated to get the dynamic stiffness value (lb/in) of the grommetin the material of choice for your operating temperature range.
NATURAL FREQUENCY CALCULATION
Calculations from the grommet data tables and grommet performance
graphs are intended to determine dynamic stiffness values for E-A-Rgrommets. This stiffness data is basic to predicting overall systemresponse and system natural frequency .
The natural frequency of a particular E-A-R grommet can now be
calculated using the following formula:
Fn= 3.13     
√ K ÷ W
WHERE: Fn= Natural frequency of the grommet (Hz)
K = Dynamic stiffness (lb/in)
W = Load per grommet (lb)HOW TO CALCULATE MOUNT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCY FOR ISODAMP AND VERSADAMP ISOLATORS

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Vibration IsolationEXAMPLE CALCULATION: COMPUTER HARD DRIVE
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 (ISODAMP C-1105)
grommets at 100F . Lateral hard drive vibration produces axial grommet deflec-tion (y direction, see Figure 2). W e therefore will utilize the axial mount data forthe stiffness calculation. Four grommets will be used to support the hard drive.T wo grommets are shown in Figure 1 and two are located on the opposite side.
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 1.8
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 
0.375 ÷ 1.8 = 0.208
Use the performance graph to determine the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 
0.208 corresponds to stiffness ratio of 3.0
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1911 lb/in
Effective stiffness is stiffness factor x stiffness ratio: 1911 lb/in x 3 = 5733 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor=0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 5733 lb/in x 0.63 = 3612 lb/in
Natural Frequency Fn= 3.13  √(3612 ÷ 0.375) = 307 Hz
Isolation Performance Calculation
Cross-Over Frequency =  √2    x 307 = 434 Hz
Fd= Resonant Frequencies to avoid in computer housings: 1000 to 2000 Hz.
Frequency Ratio = Fd/Fn= 1000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz & 2000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz = 3.25 & 6.5
Per the graph in Figure 3 using frequency ratios, there will be 0.3 to 0.15

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SHOCK PROTECTION
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 grommets at
100F . The shock input: Half Sine 100G @ 2ms. The shock input creates radialloading of grommets (z direction in Figure 2, Page 11).  Therefore, we willutilize radial mount data for our stiffness calculation. Four grommets areused to support the hard drive (see Figure 1, Page 11).
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 0.9
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 0.375 ÷ 0.9 = 0.417
Use the performance graph to get the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 0.417 
corresponds to stiffness ratio of  1.5
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1153 lb/in 
Effective stiffness will be stiffness factor x stiffness ratio = 1.5 x 1153= 1730 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor= 0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 1730 lb/in x 0.63 = 1090 lb/in
Natural Frequency /H9275n= 1059 rad/sec (167 Hz)
Shock Protection Performance Calculation
Effective time duration for half sine shock is 0.637 x actual duration: 
0.637 x 0.002 sec = 0.00127 sec
T ake natural frequency x effective duration = 1059 rad/sec x 0.00127 sec =
1.35 and find response in Figure 1 using loss factor = 1.0 curve.
T ransmissibility is just slightly less than one. Calculated time response 
(via computer algorithm) in Figure 2 confirms this. Often, this is quiteacceptable where the designer wants to ensure that the system does not amplify shock.
Peak deflection for this system is 0.022 inch as determined from graph 
in Figure 3 using the C-1105 material. A curve is shown for poorly dampedmaterial such as natural rubber ( /H9257
m=0.1). The peak displacement would
then be 0.039 inch which is 77 percent higher than the ISODAMP C-1105material. This graph is valid for 100G, 2ms half sine pulses only .

T o meet a wide range of performance and assembly needs, E-A-R offers both
one-piece and two-piece styles of grommets.
One-piece grommets—ribbed and non-ribbed
Here are typical methods for installing one-piece E-A-R grommets in a frameor panel.For use in automated assembly , the preferred method of grommet 
installation is the straight-side or keyhole slot. See Figure 1. This methodaccommodates robotic assembly and is the easiest for manual assembly as well. Using this method, the grommet and the hardware recommended to optimize performance can be installed in a single step, or the hardwarecan be added later. See Figure 2.
For manual assembly without keyhole slots, E-A-R grommets can 
be heated to make them more pliable. They can then more easily be pushed into position in the frame or plate.
Two-piece grommets—bushings and rings
For non-standard-thickness panels or frames, use of two-piece grommets(bushings and rings, or two bushings, as shown in Figure 3) can provide a major installation advantage. T wo-piece grommets eliminate the needfor preheating. The two pieces are installed from opposite sides to accommodate many panel thicknesses.
Hardware
Common hardware, typically used with E-A-R grommets to mechanically limitpreload, is shown in Figure 4. The hardware may include a shoulder bolt withwasher, plastic or metal spacer, sleeve, or locking nuts with bolt and washers.
Optimum performance of vibration and shock is generally achieved with 
5 to 10 percent preloading of E-A-R grommets, especially for ribbed styles. The ideal hardware height to obtain maximum recommended preload canbe calculated from the formula Hardware Height = 0.91 (H) + 0.09(G),
where H is the overall grommet height and Gis the thickness of the mount-
ing plate. See Figure 5.
FAN MOUNTS
Here are typical methods for installing ISODAMP fan mounts. Pull one opening of the “isolation disk” into the hole in the sheet metal. Pull
the fan mount into sheet metal hole in a rotational motion. See Figure 6.Repeat until all the fan mounts are in all the sheet metal holes.
Align all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the fan mounts
while pulling the tip of each individual fan mount through the holes in thefan. See Figure 7./H9278 D

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate two alternate installation methods.Basic Keyhole: Slide fan mounts into the keyholes on the sheet metal. Align
all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the mounts, pullingeach mount through the corresponding hole in the fan. See Figure 8.
Rotational Keyhole: First pull all the fan mounts through the holes on the
fan. Position the fan and mount assembly over the sheet metal. Push all thefan mount bases into the large portion of the keyhole. Rotate the assemblyuntil it locks in place. See Figure 9.

E-A-R fan mounts can be designed with a throw-away tip that breaks awaywith a firm tug after the fan has been installed. See Figure 10. The forcerequired to pull the mount through the fan holes should be less than 1.5 lbf.Break-off force for the tip is about 3 lbf. Figure 11 shows another option—a“double Xmas tree design”— which can accommodate two different flangethicknesses.
For even greater flexibility in manufacturing assembly , fan mounts can be
designed for two-way pull-through installation. See Figure 12. This allows thechoice of pulling the mount through either the fan holes or the sheet metalholes first.
ISOLOSS SANDWICH MOUNTS
As shown in Figure 13, ISOLOSS sandwich mounts can be used to support
loads in either compression or shear, or, as in most cases, some combinationof the two. Here are some installation tips to consider when installing a mount.
Loading conditions vs. stiffness
ISOLOSS HD and VL elastomers are stiffer under compressive load thanunder shear load. Consequently , when the elastomers are used in shear,they cannot be load-rated as highly as when used in compression.
The dynamic shear stiffness generally is between 20 and 30 percent of the
compressive stiffness. Thus, a mount’s natural frequency under compres-sion loading is twice what it is under shear loading. Therefore, a mountcan be used in static compression up to its material strength limits while providing very good isolation of lateral, or shear, vibration.
Deflection in overload conditions
ISOLOSS sandwich mounts are self-snubbing under compressive overload. Asa mount is loaded to its design limit, the effective stiffness begins to increase,thus offsetting excessive deflection under overload conditions. By contrast,overload in the shear direction will increase shear stiffness only slightly . Conse-quently , shear overload is not self-snubbing. The same is true for tensile overload.
This behavior makes a strong case for engineering sandwich mounts to 
be used primarily in compression, especially in cases where occasionaloverload or excessive temperatures may occur. As a rule, sandwichmounts should never be used primarily in ten
sion. If they must be used 
in tension or shear, however, a fail-safe design, e.g., use of a retentionstrap, is especially critical. W

Reduced Frequency Nomograms
The reduced frequency format is the standardmethod for displaying damping material perfor-mance data. To determine dynamic Young’s modu-lus and material loss factor at a given temperatureand frequency, use the following steps.
1) Select the frequency of interest on the right-
hand vertical axis.
2) Follow the selected frequency line horizontally
to the left until the selected diagonal temper-
ature isotherm is intersected.
3) Draw a vertical line up and down through the
frequency/isotherm intersection, intersectingthe dynamic Young’s modulus and materialloss factor curves.
4) Draw horizontal lines from these points to
intersect the left-hand vertical axis.
5) The dynamic Young’s modulus value is read
using the Dynamic Modulus scale and the loss factor from the Loss Factor scale.MATERIAL NOMOGRAMS & PROPERTIES

Fair to PoorResistance DataOther Common Materials E-A-R Highly Damped MaterialsELASTOMER COMPARISON GUIDE
20The data listed in this guide are typical or average values based on tests conducted by independent laboratories or by the manu facturer. They are indicative only of the results obtained in such tests and
should not be considered as guaranteed maximums or minimums. Materials must be tested under actual service to determine their s uitability for a particular purpose.Incorporating preventive measures early in a product’s development
process can help sidestep unwanted noise and vibration, as well as dis-ruptive and destructive shock energy that can affect marketability . Italso can prevent the need to re-engineer, redesign or retool. Retrofittingis rarely as cost-effective as designed-in controls, and may be muchmore costly to implement in the long run.
E-A-R engineers and technicians routinely consult with product design-
ers about materials selection, design configurations, potential problemsand other critical noise, vibration and shock issues while the design is stillon the drawing board. W e don’t supply just materials. W e offer our tech-nical expertise, applications experience and testing capabilities as well.Assistance from an E-A-R applications engineer may entail a quick
phone call, complete in-house lab diagnosis or even a visit to the cus-tomer’s site. Our NO VICON lab can effectively diagnose problems andvalidate our proposed solutions, utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic andanalytical tools. Vibration shakers, drop shock tables, high-speed videoand a hemi-anechoic chamber are just a few of the tools commonly used.
E-A-R also utilizes the latest 3D solid modeling CAD systems—ProE,
CA TIA, SolidW orks and SDRC-Ideas—to examine a customer’s productduring the design stage and to develop custom solutions. Electronictransfer of large files is available through our W ebsites.

SOLUTION ENGINEERING FOR NOISE, 
BROADEST LINES OF MATERIALS AND PARTS
E-A-R Specialty Composites provides a wide range of materials
and component options for controlling complex noise, vibration,motion and mechanical shock. Standard components includegrommets, fan mounts, bushings and equipment feet. Thisextensive offering of standard parts will often provide an “off-the-shelf” solution that meets design requirements.
In addition, E-A-R offers the industry’s broadest range of 
engineered elastomer platforms specifically developed toaddress mechanical energy control challenges that are common in today’s complex OEM product designs.
Designers can choose from four standard materials platforms—
ISODAMP C-1000 Series elastomers, ISODAMP C-8002 Series 
elastomers, VersaDamp 2000 Series TPEs and ISOLOSS HD 
thermoset polyurethanes—to obtain precisely the right combination of performance and physical properties.
The ISODAMP, ISOLOSS and VersaDamp material platforms are
highly damped elastomers, exhibiting extremely low reboundcharacteristics. This ensures extremely low amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after impulsive shock or vibration input. 
In addition, the VersaDamp platform offers adjustable damping
and stiffness, enabling the design engineer to custom-tune a part’sdynamic response. VersaDamp TPEs also offer an extended servicetemperature range, making them ideal for portable electronicsand automotive applications.
E-A-R’s ISODAMP C-8002 Series thermoplastic molding material
combines excellent damping performance and mechanicalstrength with compliance to environmental and other highcleanliness specifications, for high performance solutions in a wide variety of molded parts applications.
Additional features and typical applications for each of the
materials platforms are listed at left. More detailed informationon E-A-R’s full line of elastomers is contained in materials summary sheets and technical data sheets available directly from the company, on the Website at www.earsc.com or on the electronics Website at www.earshockandvibe.com.

THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DAMPING
E-A-R damped elastomers offer important advantages over 
poorly damped materials, such as natural and synthetic rubber,silicone and commodity TPEs. These advantages are especiallyimportant when attempting to control noise, shock and vibra-tion in today’s complex and component-dense OEM products. 
Optimized Shock and Vibration Control
Vibration is typically characterized by continuous oscillatory motion
of relatively small amplitude, while shock commonly features a 
relatively large, sudden change in acceleration due to an applieddynamic force. Consequently, vibration and shock considerationsoften place conflicting requirements on an isolation system.
A poorly damped isolator (typically made from natural rubber 
or silicone), that is soft enough for good vibration isolation, may require more sway space for deflection during a shock input than the product’s design can provide. So a stiffer isolatormay be needed to prevent crashing or bottoming out, but thiscould have a negative effect on vibration performance. E-A-R’shighly damped elastomers help mitigate this common conflict.
Traditional practice has dictated that the natural frequency of 
an isolation mount be well below the operating frequency of the vibration source. This tactic seeks to avoid a situation wherethe source’s operational frequency is near the mount’s naturalfrequency, causing excessive amplification of the transmittedvibration. In practice, though, it is often difficult to avoid excitation of the isolation system’s resonance, especially in complex systems that cycle on and off, change speed or produce broadband, multi- frequency vibration. 
With E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, vibration amplification 
is minimized. Figure 1 illustrates how an elastomer’s loss factor (
/H9257m, a measure of hysteretic damping) influences vibration
amplification. E-A-R’s elastomers, with material loss factors near 1.0, exhibit a maximum amplification of only 3 to 5 dB (1.4X to 1.8X). Natural rubber or silicone isolators, with loss factors as low as 0.05, can exhibit excessive amplification as high as 25dB (18X). This reduced amplification minimizes the traditional need for an isolation system with a low naturalfrequency. As a result, a stiffer mount can be used to betteraccommodate shock requirements while still providing the vibration isolation performance necessary for most noise control applications. 
Shock Protection: Reducing Space, Time and Magnitude

to shock input, compared to poorly damped elastomers.
 Dramatically reduced settling time after shock input. 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the loss factor of an isolator 
material can influence shock response (transmitted accelerationand peak deflection). E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, withloss factors near 1.0, provide lower peak acceleration and deflection resulting in a higher degree of shock protection within a smaller package design. Poorly damped elastomersoften require twice as much sway space to provide the samelevel of shock protection. This benefit is critical given the tightspace constraints that are common in today’s smaller portableelectronic devices and component-dense OEM products.
In addition, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, E-A-R elastomers provide
a quick return to equilibrium while the poorly damped system continues to oscillate and flex. Post-shock, resonant oscillation is a primary contributor to electromechanical system performanceloss and component fatigue failure in portable electronic devices.E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers help to reduce these post-shockoscillations, increase product performance and extend product life.

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Predicting E-A-R isolator performance is simple. Just follow the 
instructions below and refer to the grommet data tables andperformance graphs beginning on Page 4. 
DETERMINING DYNAMIC STIFFNESS
Select a candidate ISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet based on your
application parameters—load per isolator, axial (horizontal plate) orradial (vertical plate) orientation, and plate dimensions. Follow thesesteps to determine a grommet’s dynamic stiffness by using the data tableand performance graph for the grommet style you have chosen.
From the data table —Locate the load factor for the chosen grommet
and orientation (axial or radial). Now , divide the  grommet load(lb/grommet) by the load factor. The result is the load ratio.
 To the performance graph —Locate the load ratio value on the
curve (x-axis), and read the resulting stiffness ratio from the y-axis.
 Back to the data table —Multiply this stiffness ratio value by the
stiffness factor. And this is the per grommet stiffness (lb/in).
CORRECTION FOR ELASTOMER FORMULA-
TION AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE
The stiffness calculated from the grommet data tables and performance graphs represents the dynamic stiffness for a C-1002
grommet at 70F (21C). The T emperature/ Formulation CorrectionChart above makes it easy to determine the dynamic stiffness of anyISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet for any operating temperature. 
Simply multiply the correction factor from this chart by the stiffnessjust calculated to get the dynamic stiffness value (lb/in) of the grommetin the material of choice for your operating temperature range.
NATURAL FREQUENCY CALCULATION
Calculations from the grommet data tables and grommet performance
graphs are intended to determine dynamic stiffness values for E-A-Rgrommets. This stiffness data is basic to predicting overall systemresponse and system natural frequency .
The natural frequency of a particular E-A-R grommet can now be
calculated using the following formula:
Fn= 3.13     
√ K ÷ W
WHERE: Fn= Natural frequency of the grommet (Hz)
K = Dynamic stiffness (lb/in)
W = Load per grommet (lb)HOW TO CALCULATE MOUNT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCY FOR ISODAMP AND VERSADAMP ISOLATORS

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Vibration IsolationEXAMPLE CALCULATION: COMPUTER HARD DRIVE
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 (ISODAMP C-1105)
grommets at 100F . Lateral hard drive vibration produces axial grommet deflec-tion (y direction, see Figure 2). W e therefore will utilize the axial mount data forthe stiffness calculation. Four grommets will be used to support the hard drive.T wo grommets are shown in Figure 1 and two are located on the opposite side.
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 1.8
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 
0.375 ÷ 1.8 = 0.208
Use the performance graph to determine the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 
0.208 corresponds to stiffness ratio of 3.0
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1911 lb/in
Effective stiffness is stiffness factor x stiffness ratio: 1911 lb/in x 3 = 5733 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor=0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 5733 lb/in x 0.63 = 3612 lb/in
Natural Frequency Fn= 3.13  √(3612 ÷ 0.375) = 307 Hz
Isolation Performance Calculation
Cross-Over Frequency =  √2    x 307 = 434 Hz
Fd= Resonant Frequencies to avoid in computer housings: 1000 to 2000 Hz.
Frequency Ratio = Fd/Fn= 1000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz & 2000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz = 3.25 & 6.5
Per the graph in Figure 3 using frequency ratios, there will be 0.3 to 0.15

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SHOCK PROTECTION
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 grommets at
100F . The shock input: Half Sine 100G @ 2ms. The shock input creates radialloading of grommets (z direction in Figure 2, Page 11).  Therefore, we willutilize radial mount data for our stiffness calculation. Four grommets areused to support the hard drive (see Figure 1, Page 11).
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 0.9
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 0.375 ÷ 0.9 = 0.417
Use the performance graph to get the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 0.417 
corresponds to stiffness ratio of  1.5
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1153 lb/in 
Effective stiffness will be stiffness factor x stiffness ratio = 1.5 x 1153= 1730 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor= 0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 1730 lb/in x 0.63 = 1090 lb/in
Natural Frequency /H9275n= 1059 rad/sec (167 Hz)
Shock Protection Performance Calculation
Effective time duration for half sine shock is 0.637 x actual duration: 
0.637 x 0.002 sec = 0.00127 sec
T ake natural frequency x effective duration = 1059 rad/sec x 0.00127 sec =
1.35 and find response in Figure 1 using loss factor = 1.0 curve.
T ransmissibility is just slightly less than one. Calculated time response 
(via computer algorithm) in Figure 2 confirms this. Often, this is quiteacceptable where the designer wants to ensure that the system does not amplify shock.
Peak deflection for this system is 0.022 inch as determined from graph 
in Figure 3 using the C-1105 material. A curve is shown for poorly dampedmaterial such as natural rubber ( /H9257
m=0.1). The peak displacement would
then be 0.039 inch which is 77 percent higher than the ISODAMP C-1105material. This graph is valid for 100G, 2ms half sine pulses only .
Additional theory on shock protection calculations can be found in most
shock and vibration handbooks.120

E-mail: solutions@earsc.com Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  GROMMETS
T o meet a wide range of performance and assembly needs, E-A-R offers both
one-piece and two-piece styles of grommets.
One-piece grommets—ribbed and non-ribbed
Here are typical methods for installing one-piece E-A-R grommets in a frameor panel.For use in automated assembly , the preferred method of grommet 
installation is the straight-side or keyhole slot. See Figure 1. This methodaccommodates robotic assembly and is the easiest for manual assembly as well. Using this method, the grommet and the hardware recommended to optimize performance can be installed in a single step, or the hardwarecan be added later. See Figure 2.
For manual assembly without keyhole slots, E-A-R grommets can 
be heated to make them more pliable. They can then more easily be pushed into position in the frame or plate.
Two-piece grommets—bushings and rings
For non-standard-thickness panels or frames, use of two-piece grommets(bushings and rings, or two bushings, as shown in Figure 3) can provide a major installation advantage. T wo-piece grommets eliminate the needfor preheating. The two pieces are installed from opposite sides to accommodate many panel thicknesses.
Hardware
Common hardware, typically used with E-A-R grommets to mechanically limitpreload, is shown in Figure 4. The hardware may include a shoulder bolt withwasher, plastic or metal spacer, sleeve, or locking nuts with bolt and washers.
Optimum performance of vibration and shock is generally achieved with 
5 to 10 percent preloading of E-A-R grommets, especially for ribbed styles. The ideal hardware height to obtain maximum recommended preload canbe calculated from the formula Hardware Height = 0.91 (H) + 0.09(G),
where H is the overall grommet height and Gis the thickness of the mount-
ing plate. See Figure 5.
FAN MOUNTS
Here are typical methods for installing ISODAMP fan mounts. Pull one opening of the “isolation disk” into the hole in the sheet metal. Pull
the fan mount into sheet metal hole in a rotational motion. See Figure 6.Repeat until all the fan mounts are in all the sheet metal holes.
Align all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the fan mounts
while pulling the tip of each individual fan mount through the holes in thefan. See Figure 7./H9278 D

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate two alternate installation methods.Basic Keyhole: Slide fan mounts into the keyholes on the sheet metal. Align
all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the mounts, pullingeach mount through the corresponding hole in the fan. See Figure 8.
Rotational Keyhole: First pull all the fan mounts through the holes on the
fan. Position the fan and mount assembly over the sheet metal. Push all thefan mount bases into the large portion of the keyhole. Rotate the assemblyuntil it locks in place. See Figure 9.

E-A-R fan mounts can be designed with a throw-away tip that breaks awaywith a firm tug after the fan has been installed. See Figure 10. The forcerequired to pull the mount through the fan holes should be less than 1.5 lbf.Break-off force for the tip is about 3 lbf. Figure 11 shows another option—a“double Xmas tree design”— which can accommodate two different flangethicknesses.
For even greater flexibility in manufacturing assembly , fan mounts can be
designed for two-way pull-through installation. See Figure 12. This allows thechoice of pulling the mount through either the fan holes or the sheet metalholes first.
ISOLOSS SANDWICH MOUNTS
As shown in Figure 13, ISOLOSS sandwich mounts can be used to support
loads in either compression or shear, or, as in most cases, some combinationof the two. Here are some installation tips to consider when installing a mount.
Loading conditions vs. stiffness
ISOLOSS HD and VL elastomers are stiffer under compressive load thanunder shear load. Consequently , when the elastomers are used in shear,they cannot be load-rated as highly as when used in compression.
The dynamic shear stiffness generally is between 20 and 30 percent of the
compressive stiffness. Thus, a mount’s natural frequency under compres-sion loading is twice what it is under shear loading. Therefore, a mountcan be used in static compression up to its material strength limits while providing very good isolation of lateral, or shear, vibration.
Deflection in overload conditions
ISOLOSS sandwich mounts are self-snubbing under compressive overload. Asa mount is loaded to its design limit, the effective stiffness begins to increase,thus offsetting excessive deflection under overload conditions. By contrast,overload in the shear direction will increase shear stiffness only slightly . Conse-quently , shear overload is not self-snubbing. The same is true for tensile overload.
This behavior makes a strong case for engineering sandwich mounts to 
be used primarily in compression, especially in cases where occasionaloverload or excessive temperatures may occur. As a rule, sandwichmounts should never be used primarily in ten
sion. If they must be used 
in tension or shear, however, a fail-safe design, e.g., use of a retentionstrap, is especially critical. W

Reduced Frequency Nomograms
The reduced frequency format is the standardmethod for displaying damping material perfor-mance data. To determine dynamic Young’s modu-lus and material loss factor at a given temperatureand frequency, use the following steps.
1) Select the frequency of interest on the right-
hand vertical axis.
2) Follow the selected frequency line horizontally
to the left until the selected diagonal temper-
ature isotherm is intersected.
3) Draw a vertical line up and down through the
frequency/isotherm intersection, intersectingthe dynamic Young’s modulus and materialloss factor curves.
4) Draw horizontal lines from these points to
intersect the left-hand vertical axis.
5) The dynamic Young’s modulus value is read
using the Dynamic Modulus scale and the loss factor from the Loss Factor scale.MATERIAL NOMOGRAMS & PROPERTIES

20The data listed in this guide are typical or average values based on tests conducted by independent laboratories or by the manu facturer. They are indicative only of the results obtained in such tests and
should not be considered as guaranteed maximums or minimums. Materials must be tested under actual service to determine their s uitability for a particular purpose.Incorporating preventive measures early in a product’s development
process can help sidestep unwanted noise and vibration, as well as dis-ruptive and destructive shock energy that can affect marketability . Italso can prevent the need to re-engineer, redesign or retool. Retrofittingis rarely as cost-effective as designed-in controls, and may be muchmore costly to implement in the long run.
E-A-R engineers and technicians routinely consult with product design-
ers about materials selection, design configurations, potential problemsand other critical noise, vibration and shock issues while the design is stillon the drawing board. W e don’t supply just materials. W e offer our tech-nical expertise, applications experience and testing capabilities as well.Assistance from an E-A-R applications engineer may entail a quick
phone call, complete in-house lab diagnosis or even a visit to the cus-tomer’s site. Our NO VICON lab can effectively diagnose problems andvalidate our proposed solutions, utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic andanalytical tools. Vibration shakers, drop shock tables, high-speed videoand a hemi-anechoic chamber are just a few of the tools commonly used.
E-A-R also utilizes the latest 3D solid modeling CAD systems—ProE,
CA TIA, SolidW orks and SDRC-Ideas—to examine a customer’s productduring the design stage and to develop custom solutions. Electronictransfer of large files is available through our W ebsites.

BROADEST LINES OF MATERIALS AND PARTS
E-A-R Specialty Composites provides a wide range of materials
and component options for controlling complex noise, vibration,motion and mechanical shock. Standard components includegrommets, fan mounts, bushings and equipment feet. Thisextensive offering of standard parts will often provide an “off-the-shelf” solution that meets design requirements.
In addition, E-A-R offers the industry’s broadest range of 
engineered elastomer platforms specifically developed toaddress mechanical energy control challenges that are common in today’s complex OEM product designs.
Designers can choose from four standard materials platforms—
ISODAMP C-1000 Series elastomers, ISODAMP C-8002 Series 
elastomers, VersaDamp 2000 Series TPEs and ISOLOSS HD 
thermoset polyurethanes—to obtain precisely the right combination of performance and physical properties.
The ISODAMP, ISOLOSS and VersaDamp material platforms are
highly damped elastomers, exhibiting extremely low reboundcharacteristics. This ensures extremely low amplification at resonance and rapid settling to equilibrium after impulsive shock or vibration input. 
In addition, the VersaDamp platform offers adjustable damping
and stiffness, enabling the design engineer to custom-tune a part’sdynamic response. VersaDamp TPEs also offer an extended servicetemperature range, making them ideal for portable electronicsand automotive applications.
E-A-R’s ISODAMP C-8002 Series thermoplastic molding material
combines excellent damping performance and mechanicalstrength with compliance to environmental and other highcleanliness specifications, for high performance solutions in a wide variety of molded parts applications.
Additional features and typical applications for each of the
materials platforms are listed at left. More detailed informationon E-A-R’s full line of elastomers is contained in materials summary sheets and technical data sheets available directly from the company, on the Website at www.earsc.com or on the electronics Website at www.earshockandvibe.com.

THE DIFFERENCE IS THE DAMPING
E-A-R damped elastomers offer important advantages over 
poorly damped materials, such as natural and synthetic rubber,silicone and commodity TPEs. These advantages are especiallyimportant when attempting to control noise, shock and vibra-tion in today’s complex and component-dense OEM products. 
Optimized Shock and Vibration Control
Vibration is typically characterized by continuous oscillatory motion
of relatively small amplitude, while shock commonly features a 
relatively large, sudden change in acceleration due to an applieddynamic force. Consequently, vibration and shock considerationsoften place conflicting requirements on an isolation system.
A poorly damped isolator (typically made from natural rubber 
or silicone), that is soft enough for good vibration isolation, may require more sway space for deflection during a shock input than the product’s design can provide. So a stiffer isolatormay be needed to prevent crashing or bottoming out, but thiscould have a negative effect on vibration performance. E-A-R’shighly damped elastomers help mitigate this common conflict.
Traditional practice has dictated that the natural frequency of 
an isolation mount be well below the operating frequency of the vibration source. This tactic seeks to avoid a situation wherethe source’s operational frequency is near the mount’s naturalfrequency, causing excessive amplification of the transmittedvibration. In practice, though, it is often difficult to avoid excitation of the isolation system’s resonance, especially in complex systems that cycle on and off, change speed or produce broadband, multi- frequency vibration. 
With E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, vibration amplification 
is minimized. Figure 1 illustrates how an elastomer’s loss factor (
/H9257m, a measure of hysteretic damping) influences vibration
amplification. E-A-R’s elastomers, with material loss factors near 1.0, exhibit a maximum amplification of only 3 to 5 dB (1.4X to 1.8X). Natural rubber or silicone isolators, with loss factors as low as 0.05, can exhibit excessive amplification as high as 25dB (18X). This reduced amplification minimizes the traditional need for an isolation system with a low naturalfrequency. As a result, a stiffer mount can be used to betteraccommodate shock requirements while still providing the vibration isolation performance necessary for most noise control applications. 
Shock Protection: Reducing Space, Time and Magnitude
For most OEM shock protection applications, E-A-R’s highlydamped elastomers offer two important advantages:

ISODAMP ResponseFigure 3 Lower peak acceleration ( Gs) and displacement (sway) response
to shock input, compared to poorly damped elastomers.
 Dramatically reduced settling time after shock input. 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the loss factor of an isolator 
material can influence shock response (transmitted accelerationand peak deflection). E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers, withloss factors near 1.0, provide lower peak acceleration and deflection resulting in a higher degree of shock protection within a smaller package design. Poorly damped elastomersoften require twice as much sway space to provide the samelevel of shock protection. This benefit is critical given the tightspace constraints that are common in today’s smaller portableelectronic devices and component-dense OEM products.
In addition, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, E-A-R elastomers provide
a quick return to equilibrium while the poorly damped system continues to oscillate and flex. Post-shock, resonant oscillation is a primary contributor to electromechanical system performanceloss and component fatigue failure in portable electronic devices.E-A-R’s highly damped elastomers help to reduce these post-shockoscillations, increase product performance and extend product life.

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Predicting E-A-R isolator performance is simple. Just follow the 
instructions below and refer to the grommet data tables andperformance graphs beginning on Page 4. 
DETERMINING DYNAMIC STIFFNESS
Select a candidate ISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet based on your
application parameters—load per isolator, axial (horizontal plate) orradial (vertical plate) orientation, and plate dimensions. Follow thesesteps to determine a grommet’s dynamic stiffness by using the data tableand performance graph for the grommet style you have chosen.
From the data table —Locate the load factor for the chosen grommet
and orientation (axial or radial). Now , divide the  grommet load(lb/grommet) by the load factor. The result is the load ratio.
 To the performance graph —Locate the load ratio value on the
curve (x-axis), and read the resulting stiffness ratio from the y-axis.
 Back to the data table —Multiply this stiffness ratio value by the
stiffness factor. And this is the per grommet stiffness (lb/in).
CORRECTION FOR ELASTOMER FORMULA-
TION AND OPERATING TEMPERATURE
The stiffness calculated from the grommet data tables and performance graphs represents the dynamic stiffness for a C-1002
grommet at 70F (21C). The T emperature/ Formulation CorrectionChart above makes it easy to determine the dynamic stiffness of anyISODAMP or V ersaDamp grommet for any operating temperature. 
Simply multiply the correction factor from this chart by the stiffnessjust calculated to get the dynamic stiffness value (lb/in) of the grommetin the material of choice for your operating temperature range.
NATURAL FREQUENCY CALCULATION
Calculations from the grommet data tables and grommet performance
graphs are intended to determine dynamic stiffness values for E-A-Rgrommets. This stiffness data is basic to predicting overall systemresponse and system natural frequency .
The natural frequency of a particular E-A-R grommet can now be
calculated using the following formula:
Fn= 3.13     
√ K ÷ W
WHERE: Fn= Natural frequency of the grommet (Hz)
K = Dynamic stiffness (lb/in)
W = Load per grommet (lb)HOW TO CALCULATE MOUNT STIFFNESS AND NATURAL FREQUENCY FOR ISODAMP AND VERSADAMP ISOLATORS

 Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  Vibration IsolationEXAMPLE CALCULATION: COMPUTER HARD DRIVE
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 (ISODAMP C-1105)
grommets at 100F . Lateral hard drive vibration produces axial grommet deflec-tion (y direction, see Figure 2). W e therefore will utilize the axial mount data forthe stiffness calculation. Four grommets will be used to support the hard drive.T wo grommets are shown in Figure 1 and two are located on the opposite side.
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 1.8
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 
0.375 ÷ 1.8 = 0.208
Use the performance graph to determine the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 
0.208 corresponds to stiffness ratio of 3.0
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1911 lb/in
Effective stiffness is stiffness factor x stiffness ratio: 1911 lb/in x 3 = 5733 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor=0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 5733 lb/in x 0.63 = 3612 lb/in
Natural Frequency Fn= 3.13  √(3612 ÷ 0.375) = 307 Hz
Isolation Performance Calculation
Cross-Over Frequency =  √2    x 307 = 434 Hz
Fd= Resonant Frequencies to avoid in computer housings: 1000 to 2000 Hz.
Frequency Ratio = Fd/Fn= 1000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz & 2000 Hz ÷ 307 Hz = 3.25 & 6.5
Per the graph in Figure 3 using frequency ratios, there will be 0.3 to 0.15
T ransmissibility (or 70 percent to 85 percent isolation) in that range
T o estimate peak transmissibility as shown in Figure 3, use loss factor from 
the material nomogram (Figure 4) and equation at left. ( /H9257m=0.8, T max=1.6)

COMPUTER HARD DRIVE SHOCK PROTECTION
Problem Statement
Our example is a 1.5 lb hard drive isolated with four G-411-2 grommets at
100F . The shock input: Half Sine 100G @ 2ms. The shock input creates radialloading of grommets (z direction in Figure 2, Page 11).  Therefore, we willutilize radial mount data for our stiffness calculation. Four grommets areused to support the hard drive (see Figure 1, Page 11).
Stiffness and Natural Frequency Calculation
Load per grommet: 1.5 lb ÷ 4 = 0.375 lb/grommet
From the data table on Page 4: load factor = 0.9
Divide load per grommet by load factor to get load ratio: 0.375 ÷ 0.9 = 0.417
Use the performance graph to get the stiffness ratio: load ratio of 0.417 
corresponds to stiffness ratio of  1.5
From the data table: stiffness factor = 1153 lb/in 
Effective stiffness will be stiffness factor x stiffness ratio = 1.5 x 1153= 1730 lb/in
Determine the temperature correction factor for C-1105 material @ 100F .
T emperature correction factor= 0.63.
Actual grommet dynamic stiffness: 1730 lb/in x 0.63 = 1090 lb/in
Natural Frequency /H9275n= 1059 rad/sec (167 Hz)
Shock Protection Performance Calculation
Effective time duration for half sine shock is 0.637 x actual duration: 
0.637 x 0.002 sec = 0.00127 sec
T ake natural frequency x effective duration = 1059 rad/sec x 0.00127 sec =
1.35 and find response in Figure 1 using loss factor = 1.0 curve.
T ransmissibility is just slightly less than one. Calculated time response 
(via computer algorithm) in Figure 2 confirms this. Often, this is quiteacceptable where the designer wants to ensure that the system does not amplify shock.
Peak deflection for this system is 0.022 inch as determined from graph 
in Figure 3 using the C-1105 material. A curve is shown for poorly dampedmaterial such as natural rubber ( /H9257
m=0.1). The peak displacement would
then be 0.039 inch which is 77 percent higher than the ISODAMP C-1105material. This graph is valid for 100G, 2ms half sine pulses only .
Additional theory on shock protection calculations can be found in most
shock and vibration handbooks.120

E-mail: solutions@earsc.com Aearo Technologies     a 3M company  GROMMETS
T o meet a wide range of performance and assembly needs, E-A-R offers both
one-piece and two-piece styles of grommets.
One-piece grommets—ribbed and non-ribbed
Here are typical methods for installing one-piece E-A-R grommets in a frameor panel.For use in automated assembly , the preferred method of grommet 
installation is the straight-side or keyhole slot. See Figure 1. This methodaccommodates robotic assembly and is the easiest for manual assembly as well. Using this method, the grommet and the hardware recommended to optimize performance can be installed in a single step, or the hardwarecan be added later. See Figure 2.
For manual assembly without keyhole slots, E-A-R grommets can 
be heated to make them more pliable. They can then more easily be pushed into position in the frame or plate.
Two-piece grommets—bushings and rings
For non-standard-thickness panels or frames, use of two-piece grommets(bushings and rings, or two bushings, as shown in Figure 3) can provide a major installation advantage. T wo-piece grommets eliminate the needfor preheating. The two pieces are installed from opposite sides to accommodate many panel thicknesses.
Hardware
Common hardware, typically used with E-A-R grommets to mechanically limitpreload, is shown in Figure 4. The hardware may include a shoulder bolt withwasher, plastic or metal spacer, sleeve, or locking nuts with bolt and washers.
Optimum performance of vibration and shock is generally achieved with 
5 to 10 percent preloading of E-A-R grommets, especially for ribbed styles. The ideal hardware height to obtain maximum recommended preload canbe calculated from the formula Hardware Height = 0.91 (H) + 0.09(G),
where H is the overall grommet height and Gis the thickness of the mount-
ing plate. See Figure 5.
FAN MOUNTS
Here are typical methods for installing ISODAMP fan mounts. Pull one opening of the “isolation disk” into the hole in the sheet metal. Pull
the fan mount into sheet metal hole in a rotational motion. See Figure 6.Repeat until all the fan mounts are in all the sheet metal holes.
Align all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the fan mounts
while pulling the tip of each individual fan mount through the holes in thefan. See Figure 7./H9278 D

Figures 8 and 9 illustrate two alternate installation methods.Basic Keyhole: Slide fan mounts into the keyholes on the sheet metal. Align
all the fan holes to the fan mounts. Push the fan into the mounts, pullingeach mount through the corresponding hole in the fan. See Figure 8.
Rotational Keyhole: First pull all the fan mounts through the holes on the
fan. Position the fan and mount assembly over the sheet metal. Push all thefan mount bases into the large portion of the keyhole. Rotate the assemblyuntil it locks in place. See Figure 9.

E-A-R fan mounts can be designed with a throw-away tip that breaks awaywith a firm tug after the fan has been installed. See Figure 10. The forcerequired to pull the mount through the fan holes should be less than 1.5 lbf.Break-off force for the tip is about 3 lbf. Figure 11 shows another option—a“double Xmas tree design”— which can accommodate two different flangethicknesses.
For even greater flexibility in manufacturing assembly , fan mounts can be
designed for two-way pull-through installation. See Figure 12. This allows thechoice of pulling the mount through either the fan holes or the sheet metalholes first.
ISOLOSS SANDWICH MOUNTS
As shown in Figure 13, ISOLOSS sandwich mounts can be used to support
loads in either compression or shear, or, as in most cases, some combinationof the two. Here are some installation tips to consider when installing a mount.
Loading conditions vs. stiffness
ISOLOSS HD and VL elastomers are stiffer under compressive load thanunder shear load. Consequently , when the elastomers are used in shear,they cannot be load-rated as highly as when used in compression.
The dynamic shear stiffness generally is between 20 and 30 percent of the
compressive stiffness. Thus, a mount’s natural frequency under compres-sion loading is twice what it is under shear loading. Therefore, a mountcan be used in static compression up to its material strength limits while providing very good isolation of lateral, or shear, vibration.
Deflection in overload conditions
ISOLOSS sandwich mounts are self-snubbing under compressive overload. Asa mount is loaded to its design limit, the effective stiffness begins to increase,thus offsetting excessive deflection under overload conditions. By contrast,overload in the shear direction will increase shear stiffness only slightly . Conse-quently , shear overload is not self-snubbing. The same is true for tensile overload.
This behavior makes a strong case for engineering sandwich mounts to 
be used primarily in compression, especially in cases where occasionaloverload or excessive temperatures may occur. As a rule, sandwichmounts should never be used primarily in ten
sion. If they must be used 
in tension or shear, however, a fail-safe design, e.g., use of a retentionstrap, is especially critical. W

Reduced Frequency Nomograms
The reduced frequency format is the standardmethod for displaying damping material perfor-mance data. To determine dynamic Young’s modu-lus and material loss factor at a given temperatureand frequency, use the following steps.
1) Select the frequency of interest on the right-
hand vertical axis.
2) Follow the selected frequency line horizontally
to the left until the selected diagonal temper-
ature isotherm is intersected.
3) Draw a vertical line up and down through the
frequency/isotherm intersection, intersectingthe dynamic Young’s modulus and materialloss factor curves.
4) Draw horizontal lines from these points to
intersect the left-hand vertical axis.
5) The dynamic Young’s modulus value is read
using the Dynamic Modulus scale and the loss factor from the Loss Factor scale.MATERIAL NOMOGRAMS & PROPERTIES

20The data listed in this guide are typical or average values based on tests conducted by independent laboratories or by the manu facturer. They are indicative only of the results obtained in such tests and
should not be considered as guaranteed maximums or minimums. Materials must be tested under actual service to determine their s uitability for a particular purpose.Incorporating preventive measures early in a product’s development
process can help sidestep unwanted noise and vibration, as well as dis-ruptive and destructive shock energy that can affect marketability . Italso can prevent the need to re-engineer, redesign or retool. Retrofittingis rarely as cost-effective as designed-in controls, and may be muchmore costly to implement in the long run.
E-A-R engineers and technicians routinely consult with product design-
ers about materials selection, design configurations, potential problemsand other critical noise, vibration and shock issues while the design is stillon the drawing board. W e don’t supply just materials. W e offer our tech-nical expertise, applications experience and testing capabilities as well.Assistance from an E-A-R applications engineer may entail a quick
phone call, complete in-house lab diagnosis or even a visit to the cus-tomer’s site. Our NO VICON lab can effectively diagnose problems andvalidate our proposed solutions, utilizing state-of-the-art diagnostic andanalytical tools. Vibration shakers, drop shock tables, high-speed videoand a hemi-anechoic chamber are just a few of the tools commonly used.
E-A-R also utilizes the latest 3D solid modeling CAD systems—ProE,
CA TIA, SolidW orks and SDRC-Ideas—to examine a customer’s productduring the design stage and to develop custom solutions. Electronictransfer of large files is available through our W ebsites.

This is our promise without any compromise. Whether produced in one ofour six factories in Germany or one of our eleven international productionsites, our products always have the same high level of quality. This qualitycontrol is something you can definitely rely on! And this across all levelsof production and throughout all processes: consulting customers, devel-opment, material selection through to picking certified, choice suppliersand on to the production of parts and final delivery. On top of this, ourproducts have to pass the most rigorous tests under all realistic operatingconditions: continuous stress test, salt spray test, vibration test, or preci-sion noise measuring, just to mention a few. And the product getsclearance for serial production only after all the
desired characteristics have been determined tobe just right.Environmental care is another priority withebm-papst. This is why we have developedour product line in EC technology, which makesfor very low power consumption. Due to ourmanufacturing philosophy, there is absolutefocus on environmental care in production,recycling, waste and wastewater disposal.

Information DC axial fans DC fans - specials ACmaxx / i-maxx AC axial fans Accessories Representatives DC centrifugal fans AC centrifugal fansSustainability is at the centre of our
thoughts and actions. Out of conviction!
Eco-friendliness and sustainability have always been at the core of our thoughts and actions. For decades, we have worked
according to the simple but strict creed of our co-founder Gerhard Sturm: “Each new product we develop has to be betterthan the last one in terms of economy and ecology.” GreenTech is the ultimate expression of our corporate philosophy.
7
GreenTech is acknowledged and certified.
Every step in our chain of production meets the stringent standards ofenvironmental specialists and the public. The 2008 Environmental Prizeof Baden-Wuerttemberg, the Green Award 2009, the Energy EfficiencyAward 2009 of the dena – to give just a few examples – testify to this.The environmental advantage gained in the performance of the productsdeveloped from our GreenTech philosophy can also be measured in thefulfilment of the most stringent energy and environmental standards.In many instances, our products are already well below the thresholdsenergy legislation will impose a few years from now – several times over.
Our customers profit from this every day.The heart of GreenTech is future-oriented EC technology from ebm-papst. The EC technology at the core of our most efficient motors andfans allows efficiency of up to 90%, saves energy at a very high level,significantly extends service life and makes our products maintenance-free. These values pay off not only for the environment, but every cent al-so pays off for the user! All ebm-papst products – even those for whichGreenTech EC technology does not (yet) make sense from an applicationviewpoint – feature the greatest possible connection of economy andecology.GreenTech is pro-active development.Even in the design phase, the materials and processes we use are optimi-sed for the greatest possible eco-friendliness, energy balance and –wherever possible – recyclability. We continually improve the materialand performance of our products, as well as the flow and noise charac-teristics. At the same time, we significantly reduce energy consumption.Close co-operation with universities and scientific institutes and the pro-fessorship we endow in the area of power engineering and regenerativeenergies allows us to profit from the latest research findings in thesefields – and at the same time ensure highly qualified young academics.
GreenTech is eco-friendly production.
GreenTech also stands for maximum energy efficiency in our productionprocesses. There, the intelligent use of industrial waste heat and ground-water cooling, photovoltaics and, of course, our own cooling and venti -lation technology are of the utmost importance. Our most modern plant,for instance, consumes 91% less energy than currently specified andrequired. In this way, our products contribute to protecting the environ-ment, from their origin to their recyclable packaging.
Information DC axial fans DC fans - specials ACmaxx / i-maxx AC axial fans Accessories Representatives DC centrifugal fans AC centrifugal fans8Expertise and technology
Drive expertise
For the past 60 years, all conceivable types and applications of driveengineering have played an essential role at ebm-papst. A commitmentthat is the foundation for the development of optimum drive solutions –regardless of the type of fan and its usage. DC fans are generallyequipped with electronically commutated external rotor motors; inorder to save as much space as possible, commutation electronic com-ponents are integrated in the hub of the fan. Our AC fans are mostlydriven by shaded-pole or capacitor motors based on the external rotorprinciple. In the 3900 and 9900 range of particularly slim fans, internalrotor motors are used.
Low-noise performance
Our aerodynamically optimised design and high mechanical precisionproduces outstanding noise properties in series production. So-called“soft” commutation electronics of the DC fans ensure an excellentnoise performance. By avoiding steep switching edges when the indi-vidual coils are switched, this reduces the structure-borne noise fromthe motor. Computer-aided measurements and series of analyses per-formed in a state-of-the-art sound measuring chamber are conductedon each fan model from the very beginning.Long service life
The bearing system plays a vital role both inthe long life time and quietness of devicefans. The SINTEC compact bearing providesmost of the device fans with a proven bearingsystem. Constant low noise during the entireoperating time and considerably lower shocksensitivity are the outstanding features of thisbearing technology. In addition, with regardto temperature endurance, Sintec compactbearings can be used without problems inmost applications. Despite the slightly highernoise and shock sensitivity of ball bearings,this bearing technology should be given pref-erence for fans exposed to extreme thermaland adverse application conditions (e.g.extreme environmental conditions, criticalinstallation position, etc.). The service life dataprovided in this catalogue is based on exten-sive service life tests and mathematically /scientifically proven service life calculations.Our product descriptions are continuouslyupdated with all relevant data obtained fromlong-term tests.
9Streamline: Aerodynamics
With the aid of state-of-the-art computer programs, we are able tooptimise the fan impellers and the inner shape of the housing. Airoutput and available motor performance are exactly matched with thesize of fan. This guarantees the low noise that is typical for ebm-papst,even at high back pressure.
Sturdy construction – in metal or plastic
Fans of all-metal construction: Sturdy and indestructible. The housingis made of an aluminium alloy whereas the metal surfaces that aresubject to corrosion are permanently protected by an impact- andabrasion-resistant electrophoretic baked enamel. This particular ver-sion is highly recyclable. Fans with fibreglass-reinforced plastic hous-ing and impeller: Excellent stability and low weight distinguishthis highly efficient fan concept. Combinations of metal housing andplastic impeller unite the advantages of both types of design.

All fans conform to the European StandardEN 60335 or EN 60950 plus those of the UL(Underwriters Laboratories) and CSA (CanadianStandards Association).With few exceptions, our DC fans are designedto meet the requirements of protection class 3/ protection class voltage. ACmaxx fans areprotection class 2 / AC fans are protectionclass 1. ebm-papst fans meet the highestrequirements of electrical safety. Depending onthe type, they are either impedance protectedor equipped with a temperature safety switch,electronic locked-rotor protection, alarm func-tion or have speed monitoring and speed con-trol.
Quality in detail
It is the seemingly trivial that makes thedifference when a product is labelled ‘madeby ebm-papst’: consistent maintenance ofdevelopment and design engineering specifica-tions; target-oriented design; and assuredquality across the entire process chain are thereasons why running times of over 150,000hours are not unusual. The no-compromiseebm-papst quality assurance spans over allprocess levels – from the choice of materialsand the use of carefully selected, certified sup-pliers, from the production of parts up to finalassembly. The sum of all these apparentlyminor details results in fan products with supe-rior lifetimes and reliability.

ebm-papst has always developed customer-
specific intelligent fans which meet the exactrequirements of the application. We providea wide range of standard fan types, in manysizes and designs; with intelligent motor featu-res, monitoring and control functions as wellas special designs for use under extreme con-ditions. They are all based on the standardtype fans which you will find in this catalogue.Special fan types for your application can beproduced in economical batch sizes. Ourexpert engineers will assist you in selectingthe right configuration.
Innovation at its best:
Vario-Pro®with “intelligence inside”. Its pro-
grammed intelligence thanks to customer-spe-cifically configured software modules makesthe cooling of electronics even more economi-cal and flexible. For example, temperature-dependent speed profiles are possible with anumber of freely selectable interpolationpoints. External speed settings and a variety ofcombinable alarm and tachometer functionscan also be programmed. The digital motormanagement achieves high control accuracy.
Practice-oriented: Fans – customised and intelligent11Higher protection class for every type of application
ebm-papst provides, on request, many fan series in versions whichconform to the requirements of Protection Class IP 54: Their stator andall electrical components are fully encapsulated. Stainless steel ballbearings can be used for operation in particularly aggressive mediaand use under extreme environmental conditions, thus providing addi-tional reliability.
Virtually everything is possible
Regardless of your cooling and ventilation tasks, we develop the rightsolution and what is more, the most economical one. Based on the fanslisted in this catalogue, well over 4000 different versions are available.
Temperature-controlled fans
Fans with temperature-controlled speed have particularly quiet coolingcharacteristics. Thanks to integrated IC technology, they adapt theirspeed to the current cooling requirements, which results in a drasticreduction of noise in most operating modes. A temperature sensor pro-vides the fan with thermal information: either externally via a singlelead or integrated into the hub of the fan.
Speed setting via interfaces
With a wide range of DC fans with separate control input, ebm-papstprovides an alternative to the NTC-controlled types of fans. They areespecially suitable for systems and units which already have standardinterfaces for varying speed via internal switching and control circuits.The main applications are units which demand load-dependent individ-ual speed profiles or systems with stand-by minimum cooling require-ments and varied speed increase at varying power peaks.“Electronic tachometer”
thanks to sensor signalDo you wish to be informed about the currentfan speed at all times? ebm-papst has fanswith an integrated “electronic tachometer”which registers the actual value of the fanspeed. Via an integrated sensor, the fan gen-erates speed-dependent signals which can bedirectly utilised. Depending on the number ofpoles of the motor, 2, 3 or 6 pulses per revo-lution are generated.
Alarm signal for more safety
If your application requires monitored fanoperation, in addition to speed monitoring,ebm-papst also provides a multitude ofvarying alarm signals. Depending on the typeof fan in question, the signal is either static,already evaluated or interface-compatible.The alarm signal output provides reliablelongterm monitoring and a status signal ifcritical operating conditions evolve.

Extremely efficient drives andoptimised aerodynamics form the core tech-nology of the S-Force fans, which we offer inboth an axial and brand-new centrifugalmodel.
Information DC axial fans DC fans - specials ACmaxx / i-maxx AC axial fans Accessories Representatives DC centrifugal fans AC centrifugal fans12Types of fans and their function
Axial fans:
High air flow with medium to relatively high pressure build-upThe air flow in axial fans, whose impeller is similar to that of a propeller, is conducted to a greatextent parallel to the axis of rotation, in other words in the axial direction. Axial fans with free airdelivery at zero static pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing backpressure. Axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly equipped with external hous-ing and an electric motor integrated into the fan hub. This compact design allows space-savingaccommodation of all devices; the flange is equipped with mounting holes.
Diagonal fans:High flow rate at relatively high pressure build-upAt first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans. Intake is axial, whereas exhaustis diagonal. Due to the conical shape of the wheel and housing, the air is pressurised more. Indirect comparison with axial fans of the same size and comparable performance, these fans aredistinguished by the lower operating noise at high pressures.
Centrifugal fans:
High pressure build-up at limited flow rateMany of the cooling problems that occur can be optimally solved by axial and/or diagonal fans.If, for example, the required cooling air has to be conducted at an angle of 90° or if even highpressure is necessary, centrifugal fans are more effective. For your application, ebm-papstoffers not only complete centrifugal fans but also motor/impeller combinations without externalhousing.
Tangential fans:
High flow rate at low pressureTangential fans are used above all-, for large-surface air flow in devices. The air flows throughthe roller-shaped impellers twice in the radial direction: in the intake area from the outside tothe inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the outside. Whirls form in the roller due tothe vanes which guarantee a steady flow of air through the impeller.• Read down from this point to obtain the
required value for the cooling air flow.The diagram is based onthe following formula:
4. Optimum operating range
The required fan, however, must also be ableto deliver a suitable static pressure increaseΔpf, in order to force the cooling air through
the device. A fan must therefore be selectedthat provides the required air flow performancewithin its optimum operating range (see alsothe air performance curves under technicaldata).
5. Fan selection
If the requirements of an application are ful-filled by more than one fan, the noise level,space requirements, economy and ambientconditions will assist in making the final choice.V·[m3/h]≈3·Pv [w]
ΔT [K]
13Selecting the correct fan
1. Dissipated energy
A large amount of the energy consumed by electrical and electronicdevices is converted into heat. In selecting the correct fan, therefore,it is important to determine the dissipated energy that must be remo-ved. The electrical power consumption of the unit to be cooled, oftenrepresents a suitable value for this purpose.
2. Permissible temperature rise
The air flow which the selected fan is required to generate, is deter-mined by the dissipated energy and the permissible rise ( ΔT) of the
cooling air flow (from entry to exit of the device to be cooled). Themax. allowable ΔT depends greatly on the temperature sensitivity of
the individual device components. ΔT = 5K means e.g. that the avera-
ge air flow leaving the device to be cooled may only be 5°C warmerthan the ambient temperature (a large volume of air is required for thispurpose). A lower air flow rate is sufficient if a higher temperature dif-ference (e.g. ΔT = 20K), can be tolerated.
3. Required cooling air flow

Information on installation
When a fan is operated for the first time in an application, the user mayhave noticed that the flow rate in the device was lower than expected.What is the reason for this?• The values stated in this catalogue were determined under optimum,
constant and comparable measurement conditions.
• Ideal mounting conditions under which free air intake and exhaust
are present are seldom feasible in practice. Quite frequently the fansmust be mounted in close proximity to other components or cabinetpanels. As a consequence, the intake and exhaust currents may berestricted, causing the air flow to diminish and the noise level toincrease. Fans are particularly sensitive to obstructions which arepositioned directly in front of the output cross section as they oftencause an increase in tonal noise.
Our advice: The distance between the fan and adjacent components
should be at least equal to the installation depth of the fan.Intake or exhaust side installation
Under ideal conditions, the operating point isrepresented as the intersection between thefan and loss curves, regardless of whether thefan is positioned at the air intake or exhaustside of the device. In addition to ensuring therequired flow rate, several additional aspectsmust be considered for determining an appro-priate fan concept.The intake air currents of a fan are mainlylaminar, comprising nearly the entire suctionarea. By contrast, the exhaust air of a fan isgenerally turbulent, while it flows on a pre-ferred direction, e.g. axial for an axial fan. Theturbulences of the exhaust intensify the heattransfer from components within the air cur-rents, so that mounting the fan at the airintake side of the device is recommended forcooling and heating. Mounting the fan at thedevice intake is also advantageous becausethe fan will not be subjected to the dissipatedheat of the device. Therefore, it operates atlow ambient temperatures and has a higherlife expectancy.

Accident prevention
The turning rotor and the high speeds thatare sometimes involved mean that our fanproducts carry an inherent risk of injury.They may only be operated after correctinstallation and with suitable protectivefacilities (e.g. with a guard grille). Moreinformation can be found in the internet at:
www.ebmpapst.com/safety15Service life
Service life L10(40°C) and L10 (Tmax)
The values given in the first two columns have been derived from intensive, in-house service lifeendurance tests, in which our products are operated in various positions at 40°C and 70°C untilthey fail. A fan is deemed to have failed when it deviates from its defined air flow and speedvalues, or when the operating noise becomes noticeable. Such tests can take several yearsbefore a representative number of failures have been registered, and even today, some fans arestill in the process of endurance testing, even though they began tests in the 1980s. These fansare proof of the legendary reliability of fans from the Black Forest.Test results are presented in a diagram and the service life of the product L10at the temperatu-
re tested is determined on the basis of the Weibull distribution.These tests have given us years of experience in the way various design parameters and tem-peratures can affect the service life of a product. Data for service life at various temperaturesfor new products can be stated with a very high degree of precision on the basis of tests, pro-duct specifications and of commonalities in the design of the product.
New: Life expectancy L10Δ(40°C)
The new third service life column states the expected service life L10Δ. This value is based on
the calculation methods conventionally applied in the compact fan market. Again here, the foun-dations for the service life values are our service life endurance tests at high ambient tempera-tures. The service life at temperatures below the test temperatures is calculated using fixed fac-tors. This method produces much higher service life values, especially at room tempera ture (see
diagram on right).
Summary:The life span calculations have been carried out to the best of our knowledge and are based onexperience gained by ebm-papst. The specified L10 (40°C), L10 (Tmax) and L10Δ(40°C) values
all allow statements to be made about the theoretical calculated service life under certainassumptions. The values determined here are extrapolations from our own service life tests andfrom statistical variables. In the respective customer applications, different influences may occurwhich cannot be included in the calculations due to their complexity. The service life informationis explicitly not a guarantee of service life, but strictly a theoretical quality figure.

Nominal voltage (Volts)
The voltage at which the nominal values (the ta-bular values listed in this catalogue) were deter-mined. The fan operation for DC fans is not lim-ited to the nominal voltage. Fan speed and fanperformance can vary according to the permis-sible voltage range that is specified on thenameplate of each fan.
Frequency (Hz)
ebm-papst AC fans are made for operating fre-quencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Their technical dataalter accordingly.
Air flow (m3/h)
The air performance of the fan in free air opera-tion, i.e. the fan blows into the free space with-out static pressure build-up.
Fan curves
The fan curves are determined in accordancewith DIN 24 163 specifications on a dual-cham-ber test stand with intake-side measurement.This measurement technique closely approxi-mates the operating conditions experienced intypical applications for fans and yields realisticperformance curves. The curves apply to an airdensity of ρ= 1.2 kg/m3, corresponding to an
air pressure of 1013 mbar at 20 °C. Variations inair density affect pressure generation but not
the flow rate. The pressure generated at otherair densities may be estimated with the formula
Δρ2=Δρ1(ρ2/ρ1).
The nominal speed values, air flow and powerinput listed in the table were measured in freeair operation with horizontal shaft at an ambienttemperature of 20 +5 °C, air densityρ= 1.2 kg/m3after a warm-up period of 5 min.
Optimum operating range
During operation, fans are required to producean air flow with a simultaneous increase ofpressure. These operating conditions aredescribed in the section “Optimum OperatingRange”. The optimum operating range is there-fore always indicated in this catalogue in theshaded area. In this range the fans operate bestwith respect to efficiency and noise level. Withinthis optimum operating range the noise levelonly fluctuates insignificantly.
Noise [dB(A), Bel(A)]
1. Sound pressure level – dB(A)
Noise ratings of the fan in free air operation, i.e.
at maximum flow rate.
2. Sound power level – Bel(A) / dB(A)
Extent of the overall sound radiation of the fan.The sound power level is determined in theoptimum operating range.

Range of fans
ebm-papst offers you the widest full productline of DC axial and diagonal fans: From 25 mmto 280 mm in size. Every single type of fan canbe optimally integrated in the respective deviceconcept. The highly  economical brushless motortechnology of these fans provides a  uniquevariety of intelligent innovations that can berealised today at prices that would have beenunthinkable just a few years ago. 
Electronic protection againstreverse polarityebm-papst DC fans have electronically commu-tated drives with electronic protection againstreverse polarity.The electronics are convenientlylocated in the fan hub. 
Product life expectancy
A distinctive feature of DC fan technology is the convincingly high product life expectancy.Thanks to the excellent efficiency of the brush-less drives, the thermal load of the bear ings isreduced, thus con siderably increasing the lifeexpectancy of the fans.
Protection class
DC fans with sleeve and ball  bearings are  pow-ered by Class E insulated motors. All ebm-papstfans conform to the requirements of  protectionclass IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and spe-cial protection classes are also avail able. Voltage rangeMany of our DC fans can be operated on volta-ges that are up to 50% lower and 25% higherthan their nominal voltage (see Voltage range inthe technical tables). This enables the air per-formance to be adapted to the cooling require-ments and allows the noise to be reduced, evenif the fan does not have a control input.
Closed-loop speed control and monitoring 
Closed-loop speed control and function monito-ring are becoming increasingly important inmany applications. ebm-papst offers many fansin the standard design with a control input andopen collector speed signal.
S-Force The new S-Force fans with their extremely highblower capacity of up to 950 m3/h and pressu-
re build-up of up to 1200 pascals are capableof dealing with the extreme heat load. If nee-ded, these fans can produce up to 100% moreoutput under full load and they work with amuch broader delivery bandwidth than currentmodels. This makes them ideal for equipmentand systems with a high density of compo-nents. Thanks to intelligent motor features, theycan be individually adapted for any application.S-Force fans are available in 5 standard dimen-sions.Technical information

The S-Force series is the most powerful product series on the market. S-Force stands for the highest innovation in motor techno logy, fluid mecha-
nics and electronics.  The one-of-a-kind power density of the products requires special attention to the application at the cus tomer's facility.
Service life
Due to the high currents in the fans, the load on the electrolyte capaci-tors is greater, which reduces the service life of the capacitor. As a lar-ger or additional capacitor cannot be housed in the fan, the capacitormust be housed in the supply line.If the power pack of the application has a corresponding capacitor, insome cases it may be possible to omit the external capacitor.
Recommended capacitors
We recommend using the following capacitors from Rubycon:24 VDC:50 ZL 680 μF; 12,5 mm x 30 mm or 
50 ZLH 680 μF 12,5 mm x 30 mm
48 VDC:
100 YXG 470 μF; 16 mm x 35,5 mm or
100 ZLH 470  μF 16 mm x 31,5 mm
Other capacitors with equal or greater capacitance and equal or lower
serial resistance can also be used.ebm-papst St. Georgen offers the following capacitors ex stock:24 VDC: 1000 μF / 50 V, 16 mm x 25 mm
Art. No.: 992 0345 000 (LZ 354)

Product line
Our centrifugal product line includes fans forevery application. Whether as free-runningimpellers with a diameter between 97 mm and225 mm or as assemblies in a ready-to-install,compact housing with inlet nozzle with an edgelength between 51 mm and 270 mm. Of cour-se, all models feature high-efficiency, brushlessmotor technology.
Electronic protection against
reverse polarity
ebm-papst DC fans have electronically commu-tated drives with electronic protection againstreverse polarity.The electronics are convenientlylocated in the fan hub.
Product life expectancy
A distinctive feature of DC fan technology isthe convincingly high product life expectancy.Thanks to the excellent efficiency of the brush-less drives, the thermal load of the bearings isreduced, thus considerably increasing the lifeexpectancy of the fans.
Protection class
DC fans with sleeve and ball bearings are pow-ered by Class E insulated motors. All ebm-papstfans conform to the requirements of ProtectionClass IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and spe-cial protection classes are also available.Voltage rangeMany of our DC fans can be operated on volta-ges that are up to 50% lower and 25% higherthan their nominal voltage (see Voltage range inthe technical tables). This enables the air per-formance to be adapted to the cooling require-ments and allows the noise to be reduced, evenif the fan does not have a control input.
Closed-loop speed control and monitoring
Closed-loop speed control and function monito-ring are becoming increasingly important inmany applications. ebm-papst offers many fansin the standard design with a control input andopen collector speed signal.
S-Force centrifugal – RadiCal
The new S-Force centrifugal fans provide peakperformance among fans of this type. With airflow capacity at over 1500 m³/h and a pressurebuild-up of up to 1000 pascals, the highest heatflows are manageable. In addition, the modelsare extremely efficient due to the multi-pole,electronically commutated drive motors and canbe adapted individually to every applicationthanks to intelligent motor features. Somemodels use our new, highly efficient RadiCal
impellers.Technical information

Cooling capacity and efficiency
Greater power density, increasing miniaturisation and extreme electroniccomponent density are posing increased demands on the cooling capacityand efficiency of fans. The intelligent and space-saving integration of thefan in the device configuration is therefore of major importance:• Tailor-made cooling adapted to the situation as and when required.• Programmable cooling by defining speed profiles.• Transparency of function thanks to complete, interactive monitoring in
all operating conditions.
ebm-papst provides intelligent cooling concepts which are optimally
adapted to requirements. For example:
1. Speed adaptation via NTC sensor
Standard fans in electronics cooling– tried and tested by the millions andnevertheless a temporary solution, because standard fans have a distinctdisadvantage: With constant speed and a corresponding high noise factor,they continuously provide the air flow required in extreme cases. Thisextreme case only occurs-, if it occurs at all-, for a fraction of the servicelife. What is needed is an intelligent fan that automatically adapts to thecurrent cooling requirements.The ebm-papst answer: A complete range of DC
fans with temperature-controlled speed adapta-tion - in all standard dimensions.Installation is simple. The control electronicsreceive their thermal information for speedadaptation steplessly and loss-free via a tem-perature sensor either externally via a singlelead, positioned as required, or internally direct-ly in the fan hub in the air flow.
2. DC fans with separate control input
Open or closed-loop speed control is also possi-ble with DC fans that have a separate controlinput. A variation in speed can thus be imple-mented via a control voltage or a pulse-widthmodulated signal. These possibilities are usedprimarily in devices that have appropriate stan-dard interfaces and thus require a load-depend-ent variation of the fans.
Technical information
109DC fans - specials

 PWM
3. Sensor signal
DC fans with sensor signal.The integrated „electronic tachometer“ continu-ously provides an actual speed signal for exter-nal evaluation. The user is informed at all timesof the current fan speed via an extremely sim-ple signal evaluation on the customer side. Thesensor signal is via a separate lead.
4. Alarm signal
For applications which require monitored fanoperation with alarm signal, ebm-papst hasnumerous alarm signal versions, either a static,pre-processed or interface-compatible high orlow continuous signal depending on the type offan.
5. Turbo drives
Fans with three-phase EC drives and micro-processor-controlled motor electronics. Thesethree-phase motors whose torque is virtuallynon-reliant on the rotor position are used forextremely high running smoothness. The speedof these fans can be controlled over a very widerange with PWM, analogue voltage or tempera-ture. Optionally, the fans can be supplied withreversible direction of rotation and active brakeoperation.6. Vario-Pro fans
This high-end fan concept by ebmpapst with pro-grammed intelligence and customer-specific inte-grated functions makes your electronics coolingeven more versatile and competitive. Vario-Proensures a fresh economic breeze for all demandingcooling tasks – e.g. where greater reliability, moreflexibility and intelligent function features such asalarm function, speed control etc. are required.
The successful concept of Vario-Pro is: Tailor-made
software instead of fixed hardware, because pro-grammed software modules for motor control andapplication intelligence are responsible for thework that analogue components were responsiblefor in the past. This central control unit of theVario-Pro comprises a microcontroller and anEEPROM, on which all characteristics are stored.
7. Protection against environmental
influences
Some applications place particular demands on thefans' resistance to ambient influences, such asdust, moisture, water and salt. ebm-papst offersolutions for adapting fans to these ambient condi-tions.

Progress made by ebm-papst
The best example: The ACmaxx fans from ebm-papst, which, thanks to an
ingenious yet simple improvement over conventional AC fans, providesubstantial benefits.The aim in developing the new ACmaxx series was to raise the technologystandard of the conventional AC fan significantly and, in the process, facil-itate the transition to the new technology by retaining the overall mount-ing dimensions. In short, to ensure the fans can be replaced 1:1 withoutany peripheral changes or changes to the voltage situation.ebm-papst offers two generations of ACmaxx products that meet differentneeds.
Long service life
The efficiency of ACmaxx and i-maxx motors is up to 75% higher than that
of conventional AC fan variants. This not only saves energy, it also meansless intrinsic heating in the motor. The reduced heating has a direct, positi-ve effect on the bearing system, which is why the fans have a service lifethat is up to 85% longer! This also lengthens the service and maintenanceintervals significantly. The expense of replacement fans, and even moreexpensive downtimes, are kept to a manageable minimum.Technical information

126What ACmaxx and i-maxx have in common:
Energy efficiencyThe drive concept is based on state-of-the-art GreenTech EC technology
with outstanding motor efficiency. Compared to AC fans of the same size,ACmaxx energy consumption is up to 77% lower–for higher cooling capa-city! The energy balance alone means that the products pay for themsel-ves after only a few months. The savings over the entire service life, espe-cially in systems with multiple fans, is considerable.

Independent of mains frequency and mains voltage
The ACmaxx and i-maxx fans are prepared for direct connection to all AC
voltages and frequencies. The speed, and thus important properties of thefan such as air flow and noise, are independent of the power frequencyand do not change, even within the defined voltage range. Voltage fluctua-tions in the power system are automatically compensated for.AC ACmaxx i-maxxACmaxx / i-maxx

Ambient influences
AC fans are extremely common and are used in a wide variety of applica-tions. In control cabinet cooling, beer coolers, cooling cabinets, wood-bur-ning stoves, medical devices – all have different requirements for resi-stance to ambient influences. ACmaxx and i-maxx fans offer the samefeatures for protection against moisture, splash water and rough ambientconditions.
Particular design features of the i-maxx (ACi 4400):
i-maxx is more compact!
As large as existing AC fans – and not a bit larger. This is the most out-standing feature of the new i-maxx ACi 4400. Even in the hub area, thefan does not differ from typical 119x119x38 mm AC fans. Out with theAC, in with the i-maxx ACi 4400 – it's that simple.
i-maxx is more efficient!ACmaxx saves energy, and the i-maxx generation saves even more. Whilean AC fan at 50 Hz can barely reach an overall efficiency of 5-6%, theACmaxx makes it to approx. 20-25%. With the new i-maxx ACi 4400, aremarkable level of up to 30% is reached. This is the result of the optimi-sation of the entire package made up of drive, electronics, AC/DC conver-sion and aerodynamics. Thus the new i-maxx series boasts energy savingsof almost 75% compared to the corresponding AC fan, thus providing signi-ficantly higher savings than the 40% level of the old AC 4300 generation.

i-maxx is quieter!
The i-maxx ACi 4400 is quieter! Quieter than AC fans and quieter than theexisting ACmaxx generation. The reason for this is the optimised aerody-namics and the drive, which is optimised for minimum structure-bornenoise. Thus the fan is only half as loud at comparable air performance,and is up to 6 dB(A) quieter at some operating points.
Speed independent of voltage and frequency
For the i-maxx ACi 4400, the speed, and thus the air flow and operatingnoise, are independent of the supply voltage and power frequency.Versions are available for 115 VAC with a voltage range from 85 to 132VAC and 230 VAC with a voltage range of 195 to 265 VAC. Voltage fluctua-tions and frequency differences in the power system are compensated forautomatically.

Technical information
Particular design features of the ACmaxx:
Prepared for all AC voltages
These models have a very wide voltage range from 85 to 265 VAC – theglobal voltage range, so to speak. This enables the fan to be used aroundthe world, opening up large savings potentials. In addition to reduced logi-stics effort and stock-keeping, worldwide availability is key. ACmaxx iscompatible with every supply voltage–no switching needed. From 85 to265 volts and mains frequencies of 50 and 60 hertz. Voltage fluctuationsin the power system are automatically compensated for.
Higher performance
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive concept ofthis fan series is not linked to a fixed power frequency. This allows themotor speed to be increased over a wide range. Thus ACmaxx providessignificantly higher air flow and significantly increased pressure.

Product line
The renowned ebm-papst AC fans are usedwhen DC voltage is not available. The AC rangeof fans is based on experience gained fromdecades of development activity, millions ofunits in series production and competence ininnovation of a world-wide technological leader.
A wide range of fans for AC operation is pre-
sented in this catalogue. In addition to completedevice fans, you will also find fans withoutexternal housing, providing a particularly eco-nomical advantage when the air duct can beintegrated in the respective device.
Variety of sizes
AC fans are available in a variety of sizes witheither air exhaust or air intake over struts.Silent running models with sleeve bearings orfor extreme ambient conditions; fans with ballbearings are available with plug connection orexternal leads.
Shaded-pole or capacitor motors
Fan drives by shaded-pole or capacitor motors,most of which incorporate the world-famousebm-papst external rotor principle: The fanblades are directly attached to the external rotorof the external rotor motor, thus combining bothhigh performance and profitability.
Flat built AC fans
ebm-papst also has particularly flat built ACfans with internal rotor motor. Their advantage:quick start to full speed. A plastic impeller andthe both smaller and lighter internal rotor motorlead to a lower moment of inertia.Bearings
AC fans with sleeve bearings are powered byClass E insulated motors. Fans with ballbearings are equipped with Class B, E or Finsulated motors.
Protection class
All ebm-papst fans conform to the requirementsof IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and specialtypes of protection class are also available.
AC voltage
The line of AC fans for Euro voltage accordingto IEC 60038 (230 V+6% ,- 1 0% )i s basically
also available for 115 V.
Frequencies
AC fans can be operated at frequencies of 50Hz or 60 Hz. However, their technical data thenchanges accordingly.
Capacitor
Fans driven by capacitor external motorsprovide particularly high operating efficiency.Generally, the required operating capacitor isalready integrated in the fan housing.
Overloading
Almost all AC fans are protected against over-loading (e.g. due to locked rotor) the drivemotors are either impedance protected (marked“Impedance protected”, and/or “Z.P .”) or areequipped with a thermal switch (marked“Thermally protected” or “Th.P .”). The modeldesignation of these fans ends with “S”.Technical information143Axial fans for AC operation

Product line
The renowned ebm-papst AC fans are usedwhen DC voltage is not available. The AC rangeof fans is based on experience gained fromdecades of development activity, millions ofunits in series production and competence ininnovation of a world-wide technological leader.
A wide range of fans for AC operation is pre-
sented in this catalogue. In addition to completedevice fans, you will also find fans withoutexternal housing, providing a particularly eco-nomical advantage when the air duct can beintegrated in the respective device.
Variety of sizes
AC fans are available in a variety of sizes witheither air exhaust or air intake over struts.Silent running models with sleeve bearings orfor extreme ambient conditions; fans with ballbearings are available with plug connection orexternal leads.
Shaded-pole or capacitor motors
Fan drives by shaded-pole or capacitor motors,most of which incorporate the world-famousebm-papst external rotor principle: The fanblades are directly attached to the external rotorof the external rotor motor, thus combining bothhigh performance and profitability.
Flat built AC fans
ebm-papst also has particularly flat built ACfans with internal rotor motor. Their advantage:quick start to full speed. A plastic impeller andthe both smaller and lighter internal rotor motorlead to a lower moment of inertia.Bearings
AC fans with sleeve bearings are powered byClass E insulated motors. Fans with ballbearings are equipped with Class B, E or Finsulated motors.
Protection class
All ebm-papst fans conform to the requirementsof IP 20. Fans conforming to IP 54 and specialtypes of protection class are also available.
AC voltage
The line of AC fans for Euro voltage accordingto IEC 60038 (230 V+6% ,- 1 0% )i s basically
also available for 115 V.
Frequencies
AC fans can be operated at frequencies of 50Hz or 60 Hz. However, their technical data thenchange accordingly.
Capacitor
Fans driven by capacitor external motorsprovide particularly high operating efficiency.Generally, the required operating capacitor isalready integrated in the fan housing.
Overloading
Almost all AC fans are protected against over-loading (e.g. due to locked rotor) the drivemotors are either impedance protected (marked“Impedance protected”, and/or “Z.P .”) or areequipped with a thermal switch (marked“Thermally protected” or “Th.P .”). The modeldesignation of these fans ends with “S”.Technical information165Centrifugal fans for AC operation

AIRFLOW MEASUREMENT USING 
INSTRUMENTED INLET RINGS
100 Hyde Road, Farmington, CT 06034   USA      Internet:  http://www.ebmpapst.us

©ebm-papst Inc. 2006.  ebm-papst Inc. reserves the right to change any speciﬁ  cations or data without notice 10/2006   ebm-papst offers a simple airﬂ  ow measurement technique for backward-curved 
centrifugal fans using modiﬁ  ed versions of the inlet rings (IR) typically used with 
these fans to maximize performance. The technique is based on the Bernoulli and Continuity equations, which allow calculation of ﬂ  ow through a converging 
nozzle based upon measurement of the static pressure drop across the nozzle.
The applicable equation is of the form Q = 9.36k     !
s / !   Δ P , where:
    Q  =  airﬂ  ow in CFM
 k  =  nozzle calibration factor Δ P  = static pressure drop across the nozzle in inches H
20
 !s = standard air density of .075 lbs/ft3
 ! = actual air density in lbs/ft3
The calibration factor “k” has been empirically determined for each IR at standard air density of .075 lbs/ft3.  Large variations from 
this air density can effect the measurement and can be taken into account using the !s / ! ratio, otherwise this term can be dropped 
from the equation. 
Two types of instrumented inlet rings are available for each impeller size. One type uses a single pressure tap positioned near  the 
discharge end of the IR. The 2nd type uses four pressure taps spaced along the circumference of the IR, connected with tubing to form a piezometer ring. The piezometer ring averages the static pressure measurements around the circumference of the IR to provide a more accurate ﬂ  ow measurement in case of uneven pressure distribution around the inlet. In either case, the customer 
connection on the inlet ring is to a single pre-mounted tube connector, suitable for pneumatic tubing with an internal diameter  of 
4mm.  This connection should run to the low pressure side of a differential pressure transducer (DPT), while the pressure tap i n front 
of the IR is connected to the high pressure side of the DPT.  If the DPT is mounted near the front of the IR but out of the air stream, 
then the high pressure tap on the DPT is suitable and no additional pressure tap is needed. INSTRUMENTED INLET RING S
Find Instrumented Inlet Ring Part Numbe r
Using  Table 1, ﬁ nd the proper  instrumented  inlet ring P/N based  on the impeller  size and type (e.g.,  3D  EC). Choose  either 
the P/N for the IR with a single  pressure  tap or for the version  with multiple  taps connected  in a piezometer  ring.  In cases 
where  there  are mutiple  listings  for a single  impeller  size, please  discuss  the choice  of the correct  inlet ring with an ebm-
papst applications enginee r.

   size (mm)Select Pressure Transducer Range
It’s important  to the accuracy  of the ﬂ ow measurement  to select  a differential  pressure  transducer  (DPT)  with a range 
appropriate  to the expected  pressure  differential.  It’s best to choose  a DPT with a range  that only exceeds  the maximu m 
expected  pressure  differential  by a small  safety  margin.  Excessive  range  will impact  the ﬂ ow measurement  accurac y 
because the DPT accuracy is typically speci ﬁ ed as a pe rcent of full scale . 
To ﬁ nd the proper pressure transducer range :
1.  Determine  the maximum  CFM ﬂ ow rate expected  from the fan over its operating  range  as installed  in the application . 
If this info isn’t available, use the free air ﬂ ow as provided in the fan speci ﬁ cation . 
2. Use Chart 1 to ﬁ nd the pressure differential in inches w.g. for the given ﬂ ow and impeller size . 
3.  Select  a differential  pressure  transducer  with an appropriate  range  based  on the pressure  differential  determined  in  
step 2 ."

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11
Information
InformationenAxial fans: High air flow with medium  
to relatively high pressure increase  
The air flow in axial fans with an impeller that is similar to a propeller  
is conducted largely parallel to the axis of rotation, in other words  
in the axial direction. Axial fans with free air delivery at zero static 
pressure have the lowest power input that rises with increasing back 
pressure. Axial fans for cooling of electronic equipment are mostly 
equipped with external housing. The electric motor is integrated in  
the fan hub. This compact design allows space-saving accommodation 
of all devices. The flange is equipped with mounting holes.
Diagonal fans: High air flow  
at relatively high pressure increase
At first glance diagonal fans only differ slightly from axial fans.  
Intake is axial, whereas exhaust is diagonal. Due to the conical  
shape of the wheel and housing, the air is pressurized more in the  
diagonal fan. In direct comparison with axial fans of the same size  
and comparable performance, these fans are distinguished by the  
lower operating noise at high pressures.
Centrifugal fans: High pressure  
increase at limited flow rate
Generally, many cooling tasks can be performed excellently by  
axial and/or diagonal fans. But if the cooling airflow has to be  
deflected at an angle of 90°, for example, or if even greater pressure 
increase is necessary, centrifugal fans are more effective.  
For your application, ebm-papst offers not only complete centrifugal 
fans, but also motor/impeller combinations without external housing.
Tangential fans: High air flow  
with low pressure increase
Tangential fans are used especially to produce a wide airflow  
distribution through devices. The air flows through the roller-shaped 
impellers twice in the centrifugal direction: in the intake area from the  
outside to the inside and in the outflow area from the inside to the  
outside. Whirls form in the roller due to the vanes, which guarantee  
a steady flow of air through the impeller.
Types of fans  
and their function06
Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Drive know-how
For the past 80 years, all conceivable types and applications of  
drive engineering have played an essential role at ebm-papst.  
A commitment that is the foundation for the development of  
optimum drive solutions regardless of the type of fan and its use.  
In DC fans, ebm-papst set standards 50 years ago with the intro-
duction of DC fans with electronically commutated external rotor 
motors. In the changeover from AC fans to EC motors, ebm-papst 
is again doing pioneering work. EC motors for AC connection are 
highly efficient and impress with their long service life, higher air 
flow and significant pressure increase.
Smooth operation
Our aerodynamically optimized design and high mechanical preci -
sion produces outstanding noise properties in series production. 
The ""soft"" commutation electronics of DC and EC fans produce a 
very smooth operation. By avoiding steep switching edges when 
the individual coils are switched, this reduces the structure-borne 
noise from the motor. Computer-aided measurements and series of 
analyses performed in a state-of-the-art sound measuring chamber 
are conducted on each fan model from the very beginning.Long service life
The bearing system plays a vital role both in the long service life 
and the smooth operation of device fans. The Sintec compact  
bearing provides most of the device fans with a proven bearing  
system. Constant low noise during the entire operating time and 
considerably lower shock sensitivity are the outstanding features  
of this bearing technology. In addition, with regard to temperature 
endurance, Sintec compact bearings can be used without problems 
in most applications.
Despite the slightly greater noise and shock sensitivity of ball bea -
rings, this bearing technology should be given preference for fans 
exposed to extreme thermal and adverse application conditions 
(e.g. extreme environmental conditions, critical installation posi-
tion, etc.). The service life data provided in this catalog is based on 
extensive service life tests and mathematically / scientifically pro-
ven service life calculations. Our product descriptions are updated 
continuously with all relevant data obtained from long-term tests.

InformationExpertise and technology07
Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Aerodynamics
With the aid of state-of-the-art computer programs, we are able  
to optimize the fan impellers and the inner shape of the housing. 
Air output and available motor performance are matched exactly 
to the size of fan. This guarantees the low noise that is typical for 
ebm-papst, even at high back pressure.
Sturdy construction – in metal or plastic
Fans of all-metal construction: sturdy and resistant. The housing  
is made of an aluminum alloy. The metal surfaces that are subject 
to corrosion are permanently protected by an impact- and 
abrasion resistant electrophoretic baked enamel. This particular 
version is very recyclable. Fans with fiberglass-reinforced plastic 
housing and impeller: Excellent stability and low weight distinguish 
this highly efficient fan design. Combinations of metal housing and 
plastic impeller combine the advantages of both types of design.
Product images
The dimensioned drawings and product photos that appear in the 
catalog are for orientation purposes and may differ in some details

Product liability
Motors and fans from ebm-papst are components intended for  
proper installation. The customer bears responsibility for the  
overall end product.
Brand name PAPST
The PAPST mark is a registered brandmark for ebm-papst  
products and is a synonym for compact fans of the highest quality , 
functionality and reliability for decades.Safety is included
It goes without saying that all ebm-papst fans conform to the 
approval requirements of the VDE (Association of German Electri-
cal Engineers)and the standards and regulations of UL and CSA. All 
fans conform to the European Standard EN 60335 or EN 60950 plus 
those of the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) and CSA (Canadian 
Standards Association). Our DC fans are mostly designed for pro-
tection class 3 / protective extra-low voltage. AC fans for protection 
class 1. ebm-papst fans meet the highest requirements of electrical 
safety. All design variants feature reverse polarity and locked-rotor 
protection. We also have a wide selection of suitable fans for indus -
try-specific standards, such as those known from the railroad, refri -
geration or housing sectors. You can find more information in our 
industry-specific catalogs at ebmpapst.com.
Quality in detail
It is the important details that reveal the meaning of the words 
""made by ebm-papst"": Consistent adherence to development and 
design processes and a goal-oriented commitment to quality along 
the entire process chain are the foundation for the above-average 
service life of our fans. 100,000 hours and above are no longer an 
exception. The no-compromise ebm-papst quality assurance spans 
over all process levels – from the choice of materials and the use of 
carefully selected, certified suppliers, from the production of parts 
up to the final assembly. These details combine to result in reliable 
fan products with an aboveaverage service life.
ErP Directive
All products with power consumption between 125 W and 500 kW 
are subject to the European ""Energy-related Products Directive"" 
(ErP) for improving energy efficiency, with the first stage applicable 
from 2013 and the second as of 2015. Thanks to ground-breaking 
GreenTech EC technology, all of our fans and motors in these per -
formance classes already exceed the ErP Directive today.

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Practical applications: fans that are customized and smart
ebm-papst has always developed customer-specific smart fans that meet the exact requirements of the application.  
In addition to the wide range of standard fan types, we offer specific fans in many sizes, performance classes  
and designs: with smart motor features, monitoring and control functions as well as special designs for use  
under extreme conditions. They are all based on the standard type fans that you will find in this catalog.  
Special fan types for your application can be produced in economical batch sizes. Our expert engineers will assist you  
in selecting the right configuration.
Innovation at its best:
Smart and customer-specific configurable solutions increase effi-
ciency and cost-effectiveness. For example, temperature-depen -
dent speed profiles are possible with a number of freely selectable 
interpolation points. External speed settings and a variety of com -
binable alarm and tachometer functions can also be programmed.
The digital motor management achieves high control accuracy.  
Bus interfaces also offer a much greater possibility of control and 
monitoring for the digital future. 
Higher degree of protection for every type of application
ebm-papst provides, on request, many fan series in versions that 
meet to the requirements of degree of protection IP 54 and IP 68: 
Their stator and all electrical components are fully encapsulated. 
Stainless steel ball bearings can be used for operation in particu-
larly aggressive media and use under extreme environmental  
conditions, thus providing additional reliability.
Almost anything is possible
Regardless of your cooling and ventilation tasks, we will develop 
the right solution. And the most economical one.  
Based on the fans listed in this catalog, more than 4000 different 
versions are available.
Temperature-controlled fans
Fans with temperature-controlled speed have particularly quiet and 
efficient cooling characteristics. Thanks to integrated intelligence, 
they adapt their speed to the current cooling requirements. Speed setting via interfaces
With a wide range of DC fans with separate control input,  
ebm-papst provides an alternative to the NTC-controlled types  
of fans. They are especially suitable for systems and units that  
already have standard interfaces for varying speed via internal  
switching and control circuits. The main applications are units  
that require load-dependent, individual speed profiles or systems 
with minimum standby cooling requirements and varied speed  
increase at varying power peaks.
Electronic tachometer
Do you want to be informed about the current fan speed at all 
times? ebm-papst has fans with an integrated ""electronic tacho-
meter"". It registers the actual value of the fan speed. Via an inte-
grated sensor, the fan generates speed-dependent signals that  
can be used directly. Depending on the number of poles of the  
motor, 2, 3, or 6 pulses per revolution are generated.
Alarm signal for greater safety
If your application requires monitored fan operation, in addition to 
speed monitoring, ebm-papst also provides a multitude of varying 
alarm signals. Depending on the type of fan in question, the signal 
will either be static, already evaluated, or interface-compatible.  
The alarm signal output provides reliable long-term monitoring and 
a status signal if critical operating conditions arise.

Information
InformationenService life L10 (40 °C)
All values in the first column are based on in-house service life en -
durance tests in which our products are operated in several opera -
ting positions at 40 °C as well as 70 °C until they fail. A fan is
deemed to have failed when it deviates from its defined air flow 
and speed values, or when the operating noise becomes noticeab -
le. Such tests can take several years before a representative num -
ber of failures has been registered. There are still some fans in the 
process of endurance testing today that came into testing in the 
early 1980s. These fans are proof of the legendary ""made by ebm-
papst"" reliability.
Test results are presented in a diagram and the service life of the 
product L10 at the temperature tested is determined based on the 
Weibull distribution. These tests have given us years of experience 
in the way various design parameters and temperatures can affect 
the service life of a product. Data for service life at various tempe -
ratures for new products can be stated with a very high degree of 
precision based on tests, product specifications, and commonalities 
in the design of the product.
Life expectancy L10IPC  (40 °C)
The second service life column states the life expectancy L10IPC .  
This information is based on the international standard IPC 9591. 
Again here, the foundations for the service life values are our  
service life endurance tests at high ambient temperatures. The  
service life at temperatures below the test temperatures is calcula -
ted using fixed factors. This method produces much higher service 
life values, especially at room temperature (see diagram on right).Summary:
The life span calculations have been carried out to the best of our
knowledge and are based on experience gained by ebm-papst.  
The specified L10 (40 °C) and L10IPC  (40 °C) values all allow state-
ments to be made about the theoretical calculated service life  
under certain assumptions. The values determined here are extra-
polations from our own service life tests and from statistical vari-
ables. In the respective customer applications, there may be diffe -
rent influencing factors that cannot be included in the calculations 
due to their complexity. The service life information is explicitly not 
a guarantee of service life, but strictly a theoretical quality figure.Service life
Service life data from ebm-papst St. Georgen
Our fans catalog gives two different values for the  
service life of each product: 
The first column usually states the service life  
L10 at 40 °C. Exceptions are marked in the column  
headings.
The second column states the life expectancy  
L10IPC  (40 °C).

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-111. Dissipated energy
A large amount of the energy consumed by electrical and electronic
devices is converted to heat. So when selecting the correct fan,  
it is important to determine the dissipated energy that must be  
removed. The electrical power consumption of the unit to be  
cooled often represents a suitable value for this purpose.
2. Admissible temperature increase
The air flow that the selected fan is required to generate, is deter -
mined by the dissipated energy and the admissible heating (ΔT) of 
the cooling airflow (from entry to exit of the device to be cooled). 
The maximum admissible ΔT depends greatly on the temperature 
sensitivity of the individual parts of the device.
For example, ΔT = 5K means that the average cooling airflow  
leaving the device to be cooled may be only 5°C warmer than the 
ambient temperature. This requires a lot of air. A lower air flow  
rate is sufficient if a higher temperature difference (e.g. ΔT = 20K), 
can be tolerated.3. Required cooling airflow
 ■ In the diagram below, a horizontal line is drawn from the  
dissipated energy to intersect with the selected ΔT line.
 ■ Read down from this point to obtain the required value for the 
cooling airflow. The diagram is based on the following formula:  
 
 
 
4. Fan selection
But the fan you are looking for must also be able to deliver a suit -
able static pressure increase Δpf, in order to force the cooling air  
through the device. So a fan must be selected that provides the  
required air flow performance within its operating range (see also 
the air performance curves under technical data).
5. Fan selection with multiple alternatives
If more than one fan meets your requirements, the sound level,  
power consumption, space requirements, economy, and ambient 
conditions will assist in making the final choice.qV   =CPL·ρL·ΔTPV

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Intake or exhaust side installation
Under ideal conditions, the operating point is represented as the
intersection between the fan and loss curves, regardless of whether
the fan is positioned at the air intake or exhaust side of the device. 
In addition to ensuring the required flow rate, several other aspects 
must be considered for determining an appropriate fan concept. 
The intake air currents of a fan are mainly laminar, comprising  
nearly the entire suction area. By contrast, the exhaust air of a fan 
is generally turbulent and flows in a preferred direction, such as  
axial for an axial fan. The turbulence of the exhaust intensifies the 
heat transfer from components within the air currents, so that  
installing the fan on the air intake side of the device is recommen-
ded for cooling and heating. Installing the fan at the device intake  
is also advantageous because the fan will not be subjected to the 
dissipated heat of the device. Therefore, it operates at low ambient 
temperatures and has a greater life expectancy.
Information on installation
When a fan is operated for the first time in an application,  
the user may have noticed that the air flow in the device was  
lower than expected. What is the reason for this?  
 ■ The values stated in this catalog were determined under  
optimum, constant, and comparable measurement conditions.  
 ■ Due to manufacturing tolerances, both the speed of the  
drive motor and the geometric shape of the fan impeller  
are usually not exactly the nominal values but within defined  
tolerance ranges. 
 ■ Ideal installation conditions under which free air intake and 
exhaust are present are seldom feasible in practice.  
Quite frequently, the fans have to be installed in close proximity 
to other components or cabinet panels. As a consequence,  
the intake and exhaust currents may be restricted, causing the  
air flow to diminish and the sound level to increase. Fans are  
particularly sensitive to obstructions that are positioned directly 
in front of the output cross section, and they often cause an  
increase in tonal noise.
Our advice: The distance between the fan and adjacent compo-
nents should be at least equal to the installation depth of the fan.

Accident prevention
The turning rotor and the high speeds that are so -
metimes involved mean that our fan products carry an 
inherent risk of injury. They may only be operated after 
correct installation and with suitable protective equip-
ment (e.g. with a finger guard). More information can be

The voltage at which the nominal values
(the table values listed in this catalog)  
were determined. The fan operation for  
DC fans is not limited to the nominal vol-
tage. Fan speed and fan performance can 
vary according to the admissible voltage 
range that is specified on the nameplate  
of each fan. Please note that this is not a 
pulsed or modulated DC voltage.
Frequency  [Hz]
ebm-papst AC fans are made for operating
frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Their techni -
cal data changes accordingly.
Air flow [m3/h, cfm]
The air performance of the fan in free air
operation, i.e. the fan blows into the free 
space without static pressure increase.
Fan curves
The fan curves are determined in accor -
dance with DIN ISO 5801 specifications  
on a dualchamber test stand with intake 
side measurement. This measurement 
technique closely approximates the ope-
rating conditions experienced in typical  
applications for fans and yields realistic  
performance curves. The curves apply to  
an air density of ρ =1.2 kg/m3 corresponding 
to an air pressure of 1013 mbar at 20 °C. 
Variations in air density affect pressure
generation, but not the flow rate. The  
pressure generated at other air densities 
can be estimated with the formula Δρ2 = 
Δρ1 (ρ2 / ρ1). The nominal speed values,  
air flow and power consumption listed  
in the table were measured in free air  
operation with horizontal shaft at an  
ambient temperature of 20 °C - 25 °C,  
air density ρ =1.2 kg/m3 after a warmup  
period of 5 min.Noise  [dB(A), Bel(A)]

DC fans – specials
DC-Lüfter – SpecialsCooling capacity and efficiency
Greater power density, increasing miniaturization and extreme 
electronic component density are placing increased demands on 
the cooling capacity and efficiency of fans. Therefore, intelligent 
and space-saving integration of the fan in the device configuration 
is very important:
 ■ Tailor-made cooling adapted to the situation  
as and when required.
 ■Programmable cooling by defining speed profiles.
 ■ Transparency of function thanks to complete,  
interactive monitoring in all operating conditions.
Standard fans in electronics cooling have proven themselves  
a million times over.  
With a constant speed and an appropriate sound level, they  
continuously provide the air flow required for extreme cases.  
But these extreme situations occur seldom – if at all – during  
operation. What is needed is an intelligent fan that adapts auto-
matically to the level of cooling required at the time.
ebm-papst provides intelligent cooling concepts that are optimally
adapted to practical requirements. For example:Speed adjustment via temperature sensor  
ebm-papst answers with a complete range of DC fans with  
temperaturecontrolled speed adjustment via a temperature sensor, 
available in a variety of standard dimensions.
Installation is very simple. Either an external temperature sensor  
in the form of an exposed wire that can be placed anywhere, or  
an internal sensor located directly in the fan hub in the air flow  
provides continuous and undissipated thermal information to the 
control electronics for speed adjustment. A range of temperature 
sensors can be found on page 262.
DC fans with separate control input  
Open or closed-loop speed control is also possible with DC fans 
that have a separate control input. So a control voltage or a pulse- 
width modulated signal can be used to vary the speed. These  
options are used primarily in devices that have the appropriate 
standard interfaces and require varied fans depending on the load.

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Technical informationDC-Lüfter – Specials
DC fans – specialsSpeed signal  
DC fans with speed signal.
The integrated ""electronic tachometer"" continuously provides an 
actual speed signal for external evaluation. A very simple signal 
evaluation on the customer side informs the user of the current fan 
speed at all times. The speed signal is provided by a separate wire.
Alarm signal  
For applications that require monitored fan operation with an 
alarm signal, ebm-papst offers a number of alarm signals variants. 
Depending on the type of fan in question, the signal will either be 
static, already evaluated, or a continuous, interface-compatible, 
high or low signal. The alarm signal is provided by a separate wire.Powerful GreenTech motor  
Fans with three-phase EC drives and microprocessor-controlled 
motor electronics. The torque of these three-phase motors,  
which is virtually independent of the rotor position, allows the fan 
to run very smoothly. The speed of these fans can be controlled 
over a very wide speed range by means of PWM, analog voltage,  
or temperature. Optionally, the fans can be supplied with reversible 
direction of rotation and active brake operation.
Robust over the long term  
Our fan solutions offer maximum operational reliability even in 
harsh ambient conditions and are extremely durable. They with -
stand temperature changes, high humidity levels and UV light.  
We can say this with confidence because we subject each of our  
solutions to the following voluntary, extremely demanding tests:
 ■Shock and vibration test
 ■Corrosion test
 ■Highly accelerated life test (HAL T)
 ■Temperature change rain test
 ■EMC test

DC axial fanFanCheck R4R Ready for Restart
FanCheck is a diagnostic tool integrated into the fan  
electronics for determining the remaining service life  
of the fan, dependant, upon temperature, speed, and 
preset environmental parameters.
The FanCheck system emits a pulse width modulated
signal, which reflects the remaining service life of the fan. 
The pulse width is proportional to the remaining service 
life of the fan. The FanCheck signal has a pulse width of 
10 % at the end of the service life and a pulse width of  
90 % with full service life.
Basic data, such as the ball bearing system, bearing  
lubrication or lubricant used, are programmed in advance 
as parameters into the software.
The customer defines the environmental conditions,  
such as the use of fans in moist, dusty, or dirty environ -
ments; other parameters such as ambient temperature 
and speed are determined continuously. Based on all the 
influencing parameters, the software can, by means of
a complex algorithm, calculate the remaining service life 
for each individual fan.
Functionality
End of Life Indication  
Output via alarm, PWM, analog or digital signal
IT equipment such as servers, routers, and in-row cooling 
applications must be 100% operational. For this reason, 
maintenance work is often carried out during operation.
If a single fan or a plug-in unit with several fans is taken 
out of service for this purpose, this can create a tricky  
situation: The remaining fans must provide adequate  
air flow. As a result of this and the back pressure of appli-
cations, air flows through the fan taken out of service and 
it is driven by an external source, as with a wind turbine.
The problem is that when driven by an external source, 
these speeds can amount to several thousand revolutions 
per minute and in the opposite direction of rotation.
R4R manages a feat of strength: Thanks to high-torque
motors and state-of-the-art electronics, it still guarantees 
a proper start-up process, enabling efficient and fast  
system maintenance, including the replacement of fans 
while the system is running.
265Moisture protection
A coat of paint over the motor and circuit board protect the fans 
against spray water and condensation.
Degree of protection IP 54 / IP 68*
In the degree of protection IP 54, the motor and circuit boards  
are coated and therefore protected against spray water and  
moisture. The degree of protection IP 68 is important for  
ebm-papst products, as it ensures a high degree of protection  
for the encapsulated motor and electronics against foreign bodies 
and water, while protecting the user against potential hazards  
upon contact. Degrees of protection higher than IP 68 are possible 
on request. 
In addition, the IP68 protection enables ATEX certification  
according to DIN EN 60 079-7 (Group 2A, T4) for use in explosive 
atmospheres according to the certified protection class and  
resistance to salt spray.
* IP = International degree of protection marking
For AC- and EC-fans max. IP 65 available.Salt spray protection
Salt spray represents one of the most difficult requirements for 
product durability. ebm-papst has the technology to protect fans 
and blowers from salt spray reliably and for the long term.
Stainless steel bearings
Special bearings made of stainless steel provide additional  
protection.
Solutions that are available and are used may differ depending on 
the fan size. We would be glad to develop solutions tailored to the 
demands of your application.

GreenTech EC axial fans
Product overview
EC axial compact fans, in particular our new AxiACi series, stand for flexibility,  
high efficiency and enable a wide range of applications.
 
 
The wide voltage possible in EC axial compact fans reduces the logistics costs and warehousing,  
as the fan, regardless of the line voltage, can be used with its specified values: without switching,  
the EC axial fan adapts to every power supply – from 90 to 264 VAC at line frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz. 
Voltage fluctuations in the power system are automatically compensated for.
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive concept of this fan series is  
not linked to a fixed power frequency. EC axial compact fans therefore offer a significantly  
higher air flow and a significant pressure increase.
The extremely quiet and highly efficient motor impresses with its long service life  
and is equally suit able for use in technologically demanding new projects and as a replacement  
for obsolete AC solutions.

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Progress made by ebm-papst.
The best example: Greentech EC axial fans from ebm-papst. 
Our latest fans in the AxiACi series stand for flexibility, high  
efficiency and enable a wide range of applications ranging from 
cooling and ICT applications to switch cabinet cooling. The best – 
all in the same dimensions as conventional AC fans. The extremely 
quiet and highly efficient motor impresses with its long service life 
and is the perfect replacement for obsolete AC solutions in particu -
lar. The wide voltage range (90-264 VAC) and operating tempera-
tures of up to -40°C (also when starting) also offer a practical solu-
tion. Our GreenTech EC axial compact fans are available up to IP65 
as an option and, thanks to corresponding certificates, are also  
suitable for use with natural refrigerants.
Many years of experience, quality
and continuous product improvement
Better, in the same size. Our products have been developed for 
many years and have been optimized to meet your requirements. 
Our new generation of GreenTech EC axial compact fans offer  
a wealth of advantages in the same dimensions as conventional  
AC fans. This makes switching your applications to the new fans 
much easier.Quiet is not always quiet when psychoacoustic,
subjective noise characteristics are at play.
As well as increasing efficiency, one of our main objectives when 
further developing the pure AC fan series into our AxiACi series is 
significantly reducing noise as much possible – both in the aerody -
namics and in the motor. In terms of aerodynamics, we achieve this 
with perfectly designed and coordinated fan housing/fan impeller 
combinations. A motor always generates vibrations that are trans -
mitted to your application. In the worst-case scenario, in sound- 
wave form, these are considered disruptive. In the development 
phase, this structure-borne noise is difficult to predict and varies 
from application to application. Our aim is to develop motors with 
as little structure-borne noise as possible so that this problem does 
not occur in the first place. With our AxiACi motor technology,  
we have succeeded.
If we look at the sum of the acceleration levels, ACmaxx and AC 
4656N are comparable. However, AxiACi120 has a noticeable  
lower base level and also significantly lower peaks during accele-
ration amplitudes and therefore its structure-borne noise is much 
less intrusive. As a result, it also offers noise benefits for sensitive 
applications.

Compact fans for AC, DC and EC · Edition 2022-11Cost optimization
 ■ Lower energy costs due to greater efficiency  
A drive concept based on state-of-the-art GreenTech EC tech-
nology with outstanding motor efficiency level. The energy 
consumption is up to 80 % lower than in AC fans of the same size. 
The energy savings alone mean that the products pay for them -
selves after only a few months. The savings made over the entire 
service life, especially in systems with multiple fans, are worth it.
 ■ Reduction in logistics costs as independent from  
line frequency and line voltage  
The GreenTech EC axial compact fans are prepared for direct 
connection to all AC voltages and frequencies thanks to the 
""wide voltage capability"" of the fan. A certain speed version can 
be operated worldwide, regardless of the 110 VAC or 230 VAC 
power supply. Voltage and frequency fluctuations during the  
power supply operation are compensated automatically.  
This reduces logistics costs and makes warehousing easier.
 ■ Long service life  
The efficiency of GreenTech EC axial compact fans is up to 75% 
greater than that of conventional AC fans. This not only saves 
energy, it also means that the motor heats itself up less.  
The bearing system in particular responds positively to heating 
itself up less: the reason why the fans have a service life that is  
up to 70 % longer! This also extends the service and maintenance  
intervals significantly. Investments in replacement fans and 
down times, which are even more expensive, remain small 
enough to manage.Higher performance
Unlike conventional AC technology, the state-of-the-art drive  
concept of this fan series is not linked to a fixed power frequency. 
This allows the motor speed to be increased over a wide range.  
This enables significantly higher air flow rates and significant  
pressure increases.
Flexibility and countless possible uses
 ■ IP65 provides protection against harmful environmental  
influences and harsh operating conditions
 ■ Natural refrigerant? No problem!  
Safety approvals according to DIN EN 60335-2-89, 60335-2-24, 
DIN EN 60079-7 enable use with natural, explosive refrigerants
 ■ Everything is possible, from standby mode, overload mode  
at peak times or night reduction to temperature-controlled,  
quiet operation. From speed monitoring to long-term function 
monitoring via alarm or speed signal, the fans offer optional  
interfaces that allow easy and quick implementation of opera-
tional monitoring.
 ■ Further information on these fan options can be found in  
the chapter ""DC compact fan specials"" on page 252.

AC axial fans
Product overview
The tried-and-tested AC fans from ebm-papst are used wherever DC voltage is not available.  
In addition to complete devices, you will also find fans without external housing. These offer  
benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated.
 
AC fans are available in many sizes, with variants with exhaust or intake over struts  
– with plug connection or exposed connection wires.

8506 TV325 AWG 18The air flow and sound level of fans without external housing depend on the installation conditions.
The stated air flow and noise have been measured with an orifice 76.5 mm Ø at a distance of approx. 17 mm from the mounting bracket.
The air flow capacity of fan series 8000 N is achievable because of the exceptionally favorable installation conditions.  
The noise in the optimal operating range can be measured for these fans only in a specific application.304
Measuring conditions 
Air performance measured according to: ISO 5801. Installation category A, without contact protection.
Noise: Total sound power level LWA ISO 10302 measured on a hemisphere with a radius of 2 m. Sound pressure level LpA measured at 1 m 
distance from fan axis. The values given are applicable only under the specified measuring conditions and may differ depending on  
the installation conditions. In the event of deviation from the standard configuration, the parameters must be checked after installation!

Product overview
AC centrifugal fans
The tried-and-tested AC fans from ebm-papst are used wherever DC voltage is not available. In  
addition to complete devices, you will also find fans without external housing. These offer econo -
mic benefits whenever the air duct design can be integrated in the device that is being ventilated.
 
AC centrifugal fans are available in many sizes with forward or backward-curved fan impeller.  
Depending on the installation situation, it is a pure fan impeller or is combined with a housing  
with optimized air flow and noise.
Fan drives through shaded-pole or capacitor motors usually incorporate the familiar external rotor 
principle. This design combines high performance with economic efficiency. ebm-papst also offers  
particularly flat AC fans with an internal rotor motor. The advantage of these is their fast start-up to  
full speed, resulting in lower mass moments of inertia.
All fan types are designed in IP20 as standard.  
IP54/IP68 solutions and special protection types are available on request.

Axial fans
ebm-papst's axial fans prove their reputation as space-saving wonders by moving air for hot or cold
air exchange in a wide variety of devices and systems. Their outstanding features are their smallinstallation depth, low noise level and exceptional efficiency, and are particularly well suited for airflow through heat exchangers.Furthermore, in the EC version, they become intelligent ""energy-saving wonders"" for an extremelywide range of applications, primarily in ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration technology andthe automotive industry.
Table of content

Our history – Our drive
Rooted in ebm, PAPST and mvl, the three leading innovators in thedevelopment and production of motors and fans, ebm-papst hasestablished itself as the world market leader. Now as ever, our legendaryinventive spirit shines through in products that set standards in manysegments of industry worldwide. We are proud to say that despite difficultcompetition, our performance has always been exemplary and outstand-ing – in business, in our personal relationship with our customers, and ofcourse with respect to technology and engineering. For decades, we havecontributed to the world of air technology and drive engineering withsmall revolutions and large milestones.To maintain this advantage in skills and knowledge to get maximumquality and thus the highest degree of customer satisfaction, ouremployees around the world put their passion and dedication to workfor you.
Passionately involved in R&D
Our catalogues just list the results of our incessant efforts in R&D:products of highest quality and reliability. After all, it is our passion toconstantly try something new and improve what we have. In doing so,we take advantage of the latest development methods and state-of-the-art technology and invest quite heavily in R&D facilities. Best of all,though, we rely on excellently trained and skilled engineers andtechnicians to be at your service in R&D and Sales & Distribution.
Producing and safeguarding high-quality products and services
This is our promise without any compromise. Whether produced in one ofour five factories in Germany or one of our eleven international productionsites, our products always have the same high level of quality. This qualitycontrol is something you can definitely rely on! And this across all levelsof production and throughout all processes: consulting customers, devel-opment, material selection through to picking certified, choice suppliersand on to the production of parts and final delivery. On top of this, ourproducts have to pass the most rigourous tests under all realistic operat-ing conditions: continuous stress test, salt spray test, vibration test, orprecision noise measuring, just to mention a few. And the product getsclearance for serial production only after all the
desired characteristics have been determined tobe just right.Environmental care is another priority with ebm-papst. This is why we have developedour product line in EC technology, which makesfor very low power consumption. Due to ourmanufacturing philosophy, there is absolutefocus on environmental care in production,recycling, waste and waste water disposal.
Global Domestic
In order to be specialist for customised solutionsthroughout the world, you need strong partners.Global Domestic – i.e. being present all over theworld and being a national company in eachindividual country – is how we have establishedourselves in all important markets on this globewith our successful subsidiaries. And so you willalways find ebm-papst close to home, speakingyour language, and knowing the demands ofyour markets. Besides, our worldwide produc-tion alliance serves as a basis for competitivepricing. Our global services and logistic outlets,i.e. IT networking, safeguard short reactiontimes and just-in-time delivery.
All our efforts are documented in a comprehen-
sive quality management system, both for prod-ucts and services. Being certified as complyingwith the tough requirements of the internationalstandards DIN EN ISO 9001, ISO/TS 16949-2and of standard DIN EN ISO 14001 is just oneseal of approval we have received for ourunceasing efforts to provide only the bestquality products and services.
6Our key to success
Our innovations and technologies keep on turning into new industrial standards. This competitive capability can 
only be maintained by seeing ventilation as a whole: the interrelationship between, and thus the system of, motorengineering, aerodynamics, and electronics. These are our three core competencies, imminently connected andlinked in each of our products. And so we handle air intelligently and quietly and continue to set new standards indrive technology. Our system solutions form the main part of our product range by now. And they will be our mainkey to success.
Motor engineering, aerodynamics, electronics
Our drive is well known and famous with specialists: our external-rotormotor, which has made us world market leader – quietly, yet powerfully.Being versatile as to integration, it is ideally suited to the most diverseapplications. Based on this principle, we here at ebm-papst have devel-oped the widest range of fans and motor types in the world. And for hot or aggressive blower mediums, the internal-rotor motor is the perfectcomplement.
Still, in drive engineering, certain applications simply require the internal-
rotor motor principle, and they are then realised with our motors specifi-cally developed for such cases. Take, for instance, the steering supportmotor in the automotive field developed as innovation in active steering.
Be it axial or centrifugal fans, centrifugal blowers, compact fans or
tangential blowers: we always design fan blades, impeller blades andducted housings with the specific application in mind. We strive tominimise noise and to optimise efficiency. This is the challenge that we have taken up and which we meet – working away powerfully and quietly.Finally, intelligence will become the decisive
factor on all markets in future. After all, only inconnection with electronics can drive and airflow – as a system solution – have an optimaleffect in a product or application. Interfaces areavoided, and thus potential faults and failures.
Setting new standards with EC technology
Wherever intelligent air handling is required,where energy consumption needs to be reducedand performance has to be maximised, thereour EC motors are your reliable answer. They donot waste financial or natural resources.Instead, they boost high efficiency, continuouscontrollability via analogue or digital inputs,long and maintenance-free service life, androbustness.

Speed setting device
with housing
– Material: Housing made of plastic
– Type of protection: IP 54
– Design: The speed setting device can be operated with the entire range of ebm-papst 
EC fans. It is supplied with current via the fan's DC output and supplies a 0-10 V signal that allows infinitely variable open loop speed control. The control also permits fan speedmeasurement using a multimeter equipped with a frequency meter (for which a tach outputis given from the fan).
– Cable inputs: 4 x M16 or M20
– Mounting holes: Suitable for 4 mm mounts
– Speed measurement: Connect a frequency meter to the connection points 
(labelled + and -) on the PCB board. The fan has an output of 1 pulse per revolution, so that the measured frequency can be converted into rpm using the following equation:
rpm = frequency (Hz) x 60
– Comment:
• A single controller can be used to control multiple fans with the same speed setting.• The connection to the controller is made using four screw connections or one Molex
connection (adaptor lead available).
• If the tach cable is required, this device can only be connected to one fan. Note that in
rare operating cases, it is possible that permanent connection of the tach cable cancause a slight decrease in the maximum speed.

394Measurement conditions for air and noise measurement
ebm-papst products are measured under the following conditions:– Axial and centrifugal fans with direction of air flow ""V"", without guard
grille and in the wall ring
– Backward curved centrifugal fans, free-running and with inlet nozzle– Forward curved single and dual inlet centrifugal fans with housing
Noise measurements
All noise measurements are carried out in low-reflective test rooms withreverberant floor. Thus the ebm-papst acoustic test chambers meet therequirements of precision class 1 according to DIN EN ISO 3745. For noisemeasurement, the fans being tested are placed in a reverberant wall andoperated at nominal voltage (for AC, also at nominal frequency) withoutadditional attachments such as the guard grille.
Sound pressure level and sound level
All noise levels are measured in conformity to DIN 45635 and ISO 3744/3745 according to precision class 2 and specified A-weighted.When the sound pressure level (L
p) is measured, the microphone is on 
the intake side of the fan being tested, usually at a distance of 1 m on the fan axis.To measure the sound level (L
w), 10 microphones are distributed over 
an enveloping surface on the intake side of the fan being tested (see graphic). The sound level measured can be roughly calculated from the sound pressure level by adding 7 dB.

A seriesEC axial fansEC axial
S seriesQ-motor ESM EC-SYSTEMS Accessories Technology ContactsAdding multiple noise sources with the same level
Adding 2 noise sources with the same volume results in a level increaseof approx. 3 dB. The noise characteristics of multiple identical fans can be determined in advance based on the noise values specified in the datasheet. This is shown in the diagram opposite.Example
: 8 A3G800 axial fans are on a condenser. According to the data
sheet, the sound pressure level of a fan is approximately 75 dB(A).The level increase measured from the diagram is 9 dB. Thus the overallsound level of the installation can be expected to be 84 dB(A).
Adding two noise sources with different levels
The acoustic performance of two different fans can be predeterminedbased on the sound levels given in the data sheet. This is shown in thediagram opposite.Example
: There is an axial fan A3G800 with a sound pressure level of
75 dB(A) at the operating point and an axial fan A3G710 with 71 dB(A) ina ventilation unit. The level difference is 4 dB. The level increase can nowbe read in the diagram as approx. 1.5 dB. This means that the overallsound level of the unit can be expected to be 76.5 dB(A).
Inverse square laws
The sound level is independent of the distance from the noise source.Conversely, the sound pressure level decreases as distance from thenoise source increases. The diagram to the right shows the level decreaseexpressed in terms of an output measurement at a distance of 1 m fromthe noise source under far-field conditions.Example
: An axial fan A3G800 has a sound pressure level of 75 db(A) at
the operating point. Now, you want to measure the noise characteristics ata distance of 20 m. In the diagram to the right, you can now read areduction of 26 dB for the 20 m distance.

Depending on the geometrical shape of the impeller, there are differentconstruction designs, with their names taken from the main flow direction in the impeller.
The most important designs are:
– Axial fans– Centrifugal fans with backward curved blades– Single or dual inlet centrifugal blowers with forward curved blades– Diagonal (mixed flow) fans (a cross between axial and centrifugal fans)
Relevant fields of application of the various construction designs
The different ebm-papst fan and blower designs correspond to the different fields of application:– Small back pressures: Axial fans– High back pressures: Centrifugal fans with backward curved blades
and single or dual inlet centrifugal blowers
– Threshold between axial and centrifugal fans: Diagonal fansImpellers
Impellers made by ebm-papstLike pumps and compressors, fans and blowers belong to the category of aerodynamic and fluid work machines.A fan consists of an impeller, a drive motor and a housing for suspension and for guiding the air flow. The blades spacedalong the circumference of the impeller are designed in such a way as to cause the flowing work medium to changedirection, thus passing on pressure and speed energy.
Application-specific selection parameters
When selecting an application-specific fan or blower, the main parametersto be taken into account are these:– Air flow at given back pressure– Constructional design– Speed/rpm– Impeller diameter– Ambient conditions governing suction and exhaust side

Examples of obstructed inflo
ws
Instructions for designing a sufficiently unobstructed inflow:
– The distance x between the blower intake and neighbouring walls or
obstructions should be at least 25 % of the impeller diameter.
– Inflows with angular momentum or asymmetrical rotation should be
avoided.
– The inflow can be made more uniform using resistances such as those
from filters or grilles.

Motors made by ebm-papst
In AC and EC technology, ebm-papst relies on the proven external-rotor motor principle, with the rotor turning around the stator within. Advantages of the ebm-papst external-rotor principle are:– Space saving design due to integrated bearings and direct installation inside the impeller– Lower load and more precise balancing of the bearing due to the fixed connection of all rotating elements– Prolonged service life due to the motor-impeller unit placed right within the air flowThe ebm-papst motors achieve very good results in efficiency and acoustic behaviour when used in EC technology.

Open and closed loop control using ebm-papst technology
Depending on the field of application, fan speed has to be adjusted. In AC technology, the speed setting option can result in an increase in installation expenditure and, typically, a less favourable noise performance and an increase inpower input.Here, ebm-papst EC technology is a more eco-friendly and cost-efficient alternative. The EC motor with integrated commutation electronics offers high efficiency across the entire speed range and optimal acoustic performance at minimal installation expenditure.

– Continuous speed setting– Speed setting via change in motor voltage– Cost-efficient– Acoustic performance and warming has to be reviewed 
in the application
Frequency inverter with sine filter
– Continuous speed setting– Speed setting via change in frequency of rotating field– High efficiencyNote
: An all-pole sine filter (phase-phase and phase-earth) 
has to be used.When selecting a voltage controller, note that the nominal current in the
partial load range can be up to 20 % (depending on the controller) abovethe specified maximum current.416Electrical connections AC

circuits and depending on the rotor position, this commutation switchesthe motor currents on and off.
Principle of AC-fed commutation electronics
(with electrically isolated interface)
Integrated commutation electronics
– Compact unit– Easy to install– Low installation expenditure– Can be operated all over the worldNote
: Motors with 12-72 VDC supply voltage have to be fed via 
electrically isolated supply unit.
Integrated commutation electronics with switch power supply
– Protective extra-low voltage 24 / 48 VDCNote
: Switch power supply is not included but has to be ordered 
as accessory.

S seriesQ-motor ESM EC-SYSTEMS Accessories Technology ContactsTypical features of the ebm-papst commutation electronics:
– Input for analogue and digital signals– Open and closed loop control as well as monitoring of the motor– Integrated EMC filter– High efficiency throughout the entire speed range– Speed setting via linear set value (0-10 VDC) or PWM signal– Low-noise operation across the entire speed range– Minimal extra costs for additional functions 
(open/closed loop control)
– Optional BUS interfaceTypes of alarms and reactions with EC motors
With DC-fed EC motors
, certain faults in modes of operation are
recognised by the electronics, and the motor is automatically restarted.With AC-fed EC motors
, certain faults in modes of operation are
recognised by the electronics, and the motor is switched off.The motor restarts automa
tically after the following failures have been
diagnosed:– Line failure– Phase failure– Line under-voltage– DC link voltage too high or too low– Locked rotorWith the following types of failures, there is no automa
tic restart .
Here, hardware or software reset is required:– Motor temperature too high– Temperature of cooling element or ambient temperature of 
electronics too high
– Hall failure
Hardware reset
Switching off the fan and restarting it after one minute results in hardware reset.
Software reset
Software reset is via ebmBUS and LISA software, hand-held controlterminal, or PDA with Fan Control Software.420Electrical connections EC

LMR®-400 
Flexible Low Loss Communications Coax
Ideal for…
	• Drop-in replacement for RG-8/9913 Air-Dielectric type Cable
	 •	Jumper Assemblies in Wireless Communications Systems
	 •	Short Antenna Feeder runs 
 •	Any application (e.g. WLL, GPS, LMR, WLAN, WISP, WiMax, 
  SCADA, Mobile Antennas) requiring an easily routed, 
  low loss RF cable
   •	NEW! Times Protect® LP-18-400 protector-series
Size	for	size	LMR	has	the	lowest	loss	of	any	flexible	cable	 
and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line cables.
•  RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer  
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180  
dB between two adjacent cables). •		Weatherability:  LMR-400 cables designed for  
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV  
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.•  Connectors:  A wide variety of connectors are available  
for LMR-400 cable, including all common interface types,  
reverse polarity, and a choice of solder or non-solder  
center pins.  Most LMR connectors employ crimp outer  
attachment using standard hex crimp sizes.•  Cable Assemblies: All LMR-400 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies.  Refer to  
the section on FlexTech for further details. •  LMR
® standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene jacketed  
cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use. The  
bending	and	handling	characteristics	 are	significantly	 better	 
than air-dielectric and corrugated hard-line cables.
•  LMR®- DB is identical to standard LMR plus has the  
advantage of being watertight. The addition of  
waterproofing 	compound 	in	and	around	the	foil/braid 
insures continuous reliable service should the jacket be  
inadvertently damaged during installation or in the future.•  LMR
®- FR is a non-halogen (non-toxic), low smoke,  
fire	retardant	cable	designed	for	in-building 	runs	that	can	 
be routed anywhere except air handling plenums. 
LMR-FR is UL/NEC & CSA rated‘CMR’ and ‘FT4’  
respectively, meets FAA FAR25 requirements and is MSHA-P for mining applications.•  LMR
®- FR-PVC is a general-purpose indoor cable  
and has a UL/NEC & CSA rating of ‘CMR’ and ‘FT4’  
respectively. It is less expensive than LMR-FR, however  
it emits toxic fumes (HCL) and greater smoke density when burned.•  LMR
®- PVC  is designed for low loss general-purpose  
applications and is somewhat more flexible  
than the standard polyethylene jacketed LMR.•  LMR
®- PVC-W  is a white-jacketed version of LMR-  
PVC for marine and other applications  
where color compatibility is desired.
•		Flexibility and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-  
400	cable	design.	The	flexible	outer	conductor	 enables  
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar  
size and performance.
•  Low Loss is another hallmark feature of LMR-400.  LMR-400

Flexible Low Loss Coaxial Cable
Construction Specifications
 Description  Material  In. (mm) 
 Inner Conductor  Solid BCCAI  0.108  (2.74)
 Dielectric  Foam PE  0.455  (11.56)  
 Outer Conductor  Aluminum Tape  0.461  (11.71)  
 Overall Braid  Tinned Copper  0.490  (12.45)  
  Jacket  Black PE  0.590  (14.99)•  LMR® -75 standard is a UV Resistant Polyethylene 
jacketed cable designed for 20-year service outdoor use.  
The bending and handling characteristics are significantly  
better than any smooth wall or corrugated hard-line 
cables.  
•  Flexibility  and bendability are hallmarks of the LMR-
600-75 cable design. The flexible outer conductor enables  
the tightest bend radius available for any cable of similar  
size and performance.•  Low Loss  is another hallmark feature of LMR-600-
75.  Size for size LMR-75 has the lowest loss of any flexible cable and comparable loss to semirigid hard-line  
cables.•  RF Shielding is 50 dB greater than typical single 
shielded coax (40 dB).  The multi-ply bonded foil outer  
conductor is rated conservatively at > 90 dB (i.e. >180 dB between two adjacent cables). •  Weatherability : LMR-600-75 cables designed for 
outdoor exposure incorporate the best materials for UV  
resistance and have life expectancy in excess of 20 years.•  Connectors : Standard available connectors include 
type-N and type-F male plug with 75 ohm interface. Most  
LMR-75 connectors are the EZ install type with crimp outer and non-solder center contact attachment.•  Cable Assemblies : All LMR-600-75 cable types are 
available as pre-terminated cable assemblies. Refer to  
the section on FlexTech for further details.
 Ideal for… • Video Applications-CCTV, CATV, baseband or broadband
 • In-Building Feeder Runs
 • Any 75 ohm Wireless Application requiring an easily routed, 
  low loss RF cableLMR-600-75

Cable assemblies for every application
Wilcoxon Sensing T echnologies builds cables to our exacting standards for a variety of applications:
Considerations for cable selection
Cable design
Description Typical applications
Shielded, 
twisted pairShielded, twisted pair wire.Permanent sensor installations most often use 2-wire 
shielded cable because it minimizes electrical noise, 
including RFI, ESD and EMI and is compatible with standard 
2-wire sensors.
Multi-conductor 
shieldedShielded, twisted wire for use with 3, 
4 or 5 conductors.Multi-conductor shielded cable is used with 3, 4 or 5 
conductor sensors because it minimizes electrical noise.
CoaxialCarries power and signal on an inner 
conductor. The shield acts as the 
signal common.Coaxial cable is used with BNC connectors and charge 
output accelerometers. Low-noise mineral insulation cable 
minimizes triboelectric effects.
Shielding
Description Typical applications
FoilShielding made of aluminized 
mylar with a drain wire for electrical 
connection.The foil blocks high levels of RF signal, which are often found 
in wind turbine nacelles or high-speed turbines.
Braided or spiralShielding is provided by a braid 
made from many strands of small 
gauge wire and wrapped around the 
conductor(s) of a cable.Braided shielding is considered more effective at minimizing 
power line frequencies found around electric motors. Tightly 
wound braided shield also protects against RF interference.>>  Industrial process

info@wilcoxon.com                  wilcoxon.com                  buy.wilcoxon.com 2Selecting the right cable assembly for a sensor is highly dependent on factors in the environment in which 
the sensor will operate. It’s important to consider the application and the environment to ensure data 
reliability.
An applications support specialist can help you determine the cable, protection level and connector fittings 
that meet your needs. Custom cable orders are usually built in less than a week, and many standard cables 
ship the next day. All cable assemblies are built with care and precision to ensure the quality you’ve come to 
expect from Wilcoxon.MaxFlex® cablesCable protection
Description Typical applications
Spiral armored 
jacketSpiral wrap, interleaved band of 
metal surrounding a cable.The spiral armored jacket protects the cable from heavy objects 
such as those found in a hot roll steel mill, and provides chemical 
resistance due to the cable’s complete isolation from the 
atmosphere.
Stainless steel 
overbraidBraided electrical shield of 
stainless steel wrapped along 
the outside of a cable.A stainless steel overbraid protects the cable from sharp objects 
and can act as an additional signal shield. For underwater 
applications, the braid protects the outer insulation from foreign 
objects and does not trap water.
Environmental resistance
Description Typical applications
T eflon®Best temperature resistance, 
excellent chemical resistance.The cable jacket of choice for most applications. T eflon can 
withstand temperatures up to 260°C, making it ideal for high 
temperature environments. T eflon is resistant to most chemicals 
and physically strong, providing long cable life.
EnviropreneBetter chemical resistance in 
non-abrasive environments.A low-cost alternative to T eflon. Enviroprene is useful for most 
environments and protects against common exposures, such as 
UV rays found in outdoor cable tray installations.
PVC Good chemical resistance.PVC is a low-cost solution for dry air installations, but does not 
provide the same range of chemical resistances as T eflon.
T efzel®Better chemical resistance, 
rated for use in areas where 
radiation is present.Radiation resistance makes T efzel appropriate for use in nuclear 
environments.
PolyurethaneLow-cost, waterproof material 
with good abrasion resistance.Polyurethane is often used in underwater applications because it 
can be bonded to metals, creating a watertight seal to the sensor.

based data collection. With reinforced cable joints at the sensor connector end – the most common point of 
failure for similar cables due to severe handling – MaxFlex cables are reliable, durable, and resistant to wear 
and tear. They are also compatible with data collectors made by SKF, Emerson (CSI), Rockwell (Entek/IRD), 
and GE (Commtest).
>>   Extended life
     >>    Reinforced for strength and  
              maximum flexibility
           >>    Pull tested to over 100 pounds
                >>    Excellent EMI / RFI shielding
Why MaxFlex is the best
3Durable connectors – built to last
Description Typical applications
MIL-styleRugged, simple and cost-effective 
connectors available in a variety of 
pin configurations.MIL-style is the most common connector used with industrial 
sensors. They are rugged and offer a wide variety of boots 
and sealing methods for use in different environments, 
including splashproof options.
Multi-conductorLEMO, Bendix, Turck, M12 
and other multi-conductor 
connections.Multi-conductor connectors are used on data collectors, 
multi-axis sensors, dual output sensors and triaxial units. M12 
connectors are commonly used in process applications.
Coaxial2-pin connectors for use with 
coaxial cables.BNC and 10-32 Microdot connectors reduce the collection 
time associated with portable data collection.Connector typesWith a wide variety of pin configurations, options for electrical isolation between shield and transducer 
housing, data collector-compatible connectors and connectors for permanent sensor installations, Wilcoxon 
has what you need. We offer connector options for a broad range of sensor types, designed to perform 
under the conditions of any industrial environment.
For harsh environments
Wilcoxon’s model 6Q (2-pin MIL-C-5015 connector) boot used with a T eflon® coated cable, such as model 
J9T2A, has set the standard for ruggedized, submersible connector-cable assemblies. Rated IP68 and 
tested up to 650 psi, 6Q connectors are usable in temperatures up to 200°C and underwater submersible to 
a depth of 230 feet. The design of the 6Q allows it to be used both in settings where the cable shield must 
be connected to the sensor body, and in industrial applications where the shield must be isolated from the 
sensor (made possible by removing the grounding spring). The pairing of the 6QN neoprene boot and J9T2 
T efzel® cable is an ideal configuration for nuclear environments.
For process applications, Wilcoxon offers the new 6H, 6HI and 6HD2 connectors, designed for use with 
HART-compatible PCH420V sensors. The 6HD2 boot is suitable for Class I, Division 2 hazardous areas.

by Ingress Protection or IP rating. IP ratings are industry 
standards that indicate how connectors withstand invasion 
in harsh environments. In order to understand the level of 
sealing provided by a sensor connector, use the chart below.IP ratings Cable length
An accelerometer cable can be run 100 feet without losing signal 
content. The exact length before signal degradation begins can be 
determined using cable capacitance (30 pico-Farads per foot is 
common) and available voltage swing (typically at least 5 V peak-
to-peak). Using these values, the maximum length is a function 
of supply current and the highest frequency of interest. The chart 
below helps determine maximum cable lengths.
